350px | thumb | Kruskal diagram, in which the black hole region (adjacent to the upper gray area white area), the white hole region (adjacent to the gray bottom white area) is shown, and the two asymptotically flat regions in white, left and right, which describe the gravitational field around a body esférico.Agujero white is the term proposed to define a solution of the equations of Einstein's gravitational field, whose existence was believed impossible, due to as special conditions requiere.Se is a finite region of space-time, visible celestial object such as a density warps space but, unlike the black hole, lets out matter and energy instead of absorbing it. In fact no object can remain inside said region for an infinite time. Therefore a white hole as the temporary reversal of a black hole is defined: the black hole absorbs matter inside a white hole instead the expulsa.Los major advances in this theory are due to the independent work of mathematicians Yuval Ne'eman and Igor Novikov in the 1960s, based on the Kruskal-Schwarzschild solution of the equations of relativity general.El Schwarzschild black hole is described as a singularity in which a geodesic can only enter such type of black hole includes two types of horizon: a horizon "future" (ie, a region from which it can not escape once it has entered it, and in which the time-to-space are curved toward the future), and a horizon "last" last horizon is by definition a region where it is impossible to stay and which can only leave; the future horizon then it would correspond to a hole blancoonline the case of a black hole Reißner-Nordstrøm white hole becomes for now always hypothetically-the "output" of a black hole in another "universe", ie another asymptotically region similar to the region from which an emergent object that other type of hole flat. Electric charge Reissner-hole Nordstrøm provides more reasonable to build white holes possible physical mechanism. == Scenario == Unlike several black holes for which there is a physical process well studied, the gravitational collapse (resulting to black holes when a more massive star the sun exhausts its nuclear) "fuel", there is no clear process leading analogue safely produce white holes. Although have signed some assumptions: * At first it was assumed the white holes as a kind of "out" of black holes, both types of singularities probably would be connected by a wormhole (note that, as white holes, wormholes have not been found so far); when quasars were discovered it was assumed that these were the intended white holes but now that situation has been discarded. * Another widespread misconception today is that white holes would be very unstable, would last a short time and even after training could collapse and become black holes. * it has also come to conjecture that the initial singularity of the big bang could have been something of a white hole in its initial stages. == Notes ==== References == *...
