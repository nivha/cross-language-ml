A charged black hole is a black hole that has electric charge. Although the electromagnetic repulsion in electrically charged compressed mass is dramatically greater than gravitational pull (for about 40 kinds of magnitudes), are not expected to black holes with such a significant electrical charge may be formed on the charged black hole is naturaleza.Un one of 3 possible black holes that might exist in the theory of gravity called general relativity. Black holes are characterized by 3 (and only 3) qualities, which are: Mass M (called a Schwarzschild black hole if it does not possess angular momentum or electric charge) * Angular momentum J (called a Kerr black hole if this does not load), and Q * electric charge (charged black hole or black hole Reissner-Nordström if the angular momentum is zero, or a black hole Kerr-Newman if you have both angular momentum and electric charge). An article special, mathematically oriented, describes the Reissner-Nordstrom metric for a charged black hole solutions without rotación.Las Einstein field equation for the gravitational field of an electrically charged point mass (with zero angular momentum) in a empty space was obtained in 1918 by Hans Reissner and Gunnar Nordstrom, not much time later, Karl Schwarzschild found the Schwarzschild metric as a solution for the point mass with no electric charge and angular momentum. == See also == * Hole negroClasificación by type * black hole Schwarzschild black hole * Kerr * Kerr black hole and Reissner-Newman-Nordström black hole or by mass cargado.Clasificación: * Micro black hole, a black hole * Extra dimensional primordial black hole, a hypothetical spare. the Big Bang. * stellar black hole, which could be either a static black hole, as a rotating black hole. * intermediate mass black hole supermassive black hole *, which could be either a static black hole, as a rotating black hole.
