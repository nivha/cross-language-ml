A primordial black hole is a black hole that formed due to gravitational collapse of a star but the extreme density of the universe at the beginning of his expansi√≥n.De according to the standard model, during the moments following the Big Bang and the pressure temperature of the universe was extremely high. Under these conditions, simple fluctuations in the density of matter could cause sufficiently dense regions of space to generate black holes. Although most of the dense regions would be dispersed by the expansion of the universe, a primordial black hole would be stable, lasting until today.
