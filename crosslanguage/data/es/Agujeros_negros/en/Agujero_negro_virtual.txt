In quantum gravity, a virtual black hole is a black hole that has a temporary existence as a result of a quantum fluctuation of space-time. Is an example of quantum foam and gravity are the analog electron-positron pair found quantum electrodynamics. Theoretical arguments suggest that virtual black holes must have a mass of the order of the Planck mass, life is around the Planck time, and are presented with a number density of about one volume of black holes exist Planck.De virtual, they provide a mechanism for the disintegration of the protons. The reason for this is that when the black hole increases its mass by a mass that falls into the hole, and then decreases as the Hawking radiation is emitted by the hole, the elementary particles emitted in general not be the same as which cayeron.Por thus, if two of the components of a proton as quarks fall into a virtual black hole, it is possible that an antiquark and a lepton may emerge, thus violating the conservation of baryon number. The existence of virtual black holes exacerbates the paradox of loss information black hole, as any physical process can potentially be disrupted by interaction with a virtual black hole. == See also == * black hole quantum foam * == references ==== external links ==
