Scorpius X-1 (abbreviated Sco X-1) is an X-ray binary located in the constellation Scorpius. Is located at a distance of 3000 parsecs (9000 light years). Apart from the Sun, is the brightest source of X-rays in our sky. Its luminosity is 2.3 Ã— 1031 W, about 60,000 times that of Sol.Fue discovered in 1962 by a team led by Riccardo Giacconi in Cambridge, Massachusetts, by an X-ray detector aboard an Aerobee sounding rocket. In those days, was not expected to exist bright X-ray sources outside our solar system and the detector was launched with the purpose of detecting X-rays on the moon. Instead, the detector discovered Sco X-1, an extremely bright source without apparent correspondence in the visible sky. The source was later associated with a weak blue star V818 Scorpii.El system call is classified as an X-ray binary low mass. It consists of a neutron star of about 1.4 solar masses, and a companion star only 0.42 solar masses. It could be that the two stars were not born together, and the system is formed by a chance encounter in the globular cluster to which they belong....
