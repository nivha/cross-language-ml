Observations of the orbit of the star S2 around Sgr A * indicate the presence of the black hole. == History == Sgr A * was discovered between 13 and February 15, 1974 by Bruce Balick astronomers and Robert Brown the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, using interferometry technique. The name of Sgr A * was coined by Brown to distinguish this compact source of the other components of the galactic center and to emphasize his excited nature, establishing an analogy with excited in atoms states, which are denoted with an asterisk (Fe * , He *, etc). in October 2002, an international team led by Rainer Schödel the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics reported the observation of the motion of the star S2 near Sagittarius a * for a period of 10 years. According to the analysis, the data rule out the possibility that Sgr A * contains a cluster of dark stellar objects or mass degenerate fermions, strengthening the evidence that it was a supermassive black hole. Observations of S2 spectral interferometry used near infrared region (NIR) (K-band, ie 2.2 microns), because of the reduced interstellar extinction in this band. SiO masers were used to align the NIR images with radio observations, as can be seen in NIR and radio bands. The rapid movement of S2 (and other nearby stars) stands out from other stars slow moving along the line of sight so that these could be subtracted from the images. VLBI observations of Sagittarius A * could also be aligned centrally with the images, so that S2 could be orbiting Sagittarius A *. Examining this orbit estimated the mass of Sagittarius A * was 3.7 ± 0.2 million solar masses, confined in a volume with a radius of no more than 17 hours-light (120 AU). Later observations showed that the mass of Sgr a * was approximately 4.1 million solar masses of volume with a radius of no more than 6.25 light-hours (45 AU) or 6.700 million kilometers. They also determined that the distance between the Earth and the center of the galaxy (the rotational center of the Milky Way) it was 26,000 light-years or 8.0 ± 0.6 × 103 parsecs. Radio waves and infrared detected are from the gas and dust heated to millions of degrees in their fall toward the black hole. The latter only emits Hawking radiation at a low temperature of K.En 10-14 November 2004, a team of astronomers reported the discovery of a possible black hole intermediate, referred to as GCIRS 13E, orbiting three light-years Sgr A *. This black hole of 1,300 solar masses is a cluster composed of seven stars. This observation supports the idea that supermassive black holes grow by absorbing smaller black holes and estrellas.Tras monitoring stellar orbits around Sgr A * for 16 years, Gillessen et al. estimated their mass 4.31 ± 0.38 million times the mass of the Sun The results were announced in 2008 and published in The Astrophysical Journal in 2009. Reinhard Genzel, director of the project, said the study reflected "what is seen so far best empirical evidence that supermassive black holes exist.'s stellar orbits in the galactic center show that the central mass concentration of four million solar masses must be a black hole, beyond any reasonable doubt.
