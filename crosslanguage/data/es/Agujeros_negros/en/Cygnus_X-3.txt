Cygnus X-3 is a powerful source of X-rays located 37,000 light years away in the constellation Cygnus. It was discovered in 1966. Though it is only the third source of light in the constellation x-rays after the famous Cygnus X-1, is much more secluded, on the far side of the galaxy side, and is overshadowed by gas and interstellar dust near the galactic plane there. When corrected for distance, appears to be one of the two or three brightest objects galaxia.Cygnus X-3 is an X-ray binary consisting of a Wolf-Rayet star and a compact object could be a neutron star or a black hole. The two stars of the binary system orbit each other in just 4.79 hours.This object is distinguished by its strong radio and X-rays. During flares (outbursts) some day, its radio flux can be multiplied by a factor of 10000 and reach tens janskys. These flares are probably associated with ejections of matter in jets of particles. Observations of the Naval Research Laboratory conducted in October 1982 using the Very Large Array, a shock wave detected during a flare that was spreading about a third the speed of the X-3 has recently been detected luz.Cygnus ray gigaelectronvolts by gamma detectors onboard satellite AGILE and Fermi. It has never been detected at higher energy from Cherenkov telescopes on the ground.
