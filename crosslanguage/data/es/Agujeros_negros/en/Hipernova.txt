A hypernova is a theoretical type of supernova that would occur when very massive stars (above 100 solar masses masses) collapse at the end of their lives. After exploding as a supernova, the core of the hypernova would collapse directly into a black hole, emitting two extremely energetic jets of plasma from the poles to near the speed of light. These jets could generate powerful gamma rays would be a possible explanation of gamma-ray bursts. As massive stars are very rare, and therefore would also be rare hypernovae is estimated that an event of this nature can occur in our galaxy every 200 million years. The star Eta Carinae, in our Galaxy, may be a candidate hypernova. Another good candidate hypernova burst into R136a1 can be discovered in July 2010 and with an astonishing mass of 265 suns; also the LBV Pistol Star or 1806-20 may be candidates here hypernovae producing tens or hundreds of thousands of years. == See also == * Gamma Ray * Stellar Evolution
