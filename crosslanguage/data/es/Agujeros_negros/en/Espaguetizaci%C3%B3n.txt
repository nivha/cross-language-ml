In astrophysics, spaghettification is stretching objects in fine and thin shapes (like spaghetti) in a very strong gravitational field, due to extreme tidal forces. In the most extreme cases, finding these objects in the vicinity of black holes, stretching is so powerful that no object can stand it, no matter how strong its components are.
