A black microhole, also called quantum mechanical black hole or mini black hole, is a simple small black hole, in which the effects of quantum mechanics play an important role. == Introduction == According to current knowledge, the holes ordinary black allegedly formed by gravitational collapse are large objects above 3 or 4 km. Since the quantum size effects are expected to be little or no substantial, at least in the formation process and the first part of development when the size is still at least some kilómetros.Sin however, the microholes for different in this aspect, since the small mass of a black microhole could be of the order of the Planck mass, which is about 2 × 10-8 kg or 1.1 × 1019 GeV. At this scale, the formula of black hole thermodynamics predicts that the mini black hole would have an entropy of only 4π nats; Hawking temperature one \ frac {T_p} {8 \ pi}, requiring comparable quantum thermal energy at about the full mini black hole mass; and Compton length equal to the radius of the black hole Schwarzschild wave (this distance being equal to the Planck length). This is the point where classical gravitational description of the object is not valid, the quantum effects of the existence of black holes gravedad.La probably being very important with this mass is highly speculative, but if primordial black holes exist, they could achieve black microholes provided as the end of the "evaporation", due to the radiation of Hawking.De estimates according to the standard theories, the energy necessary to produce black microholes is greater by several orders of magnitude that can be produced on Earth in particle accelerators like the Large Hadron Collider (maximum around 14 × 103 GeV), or be detected in collisions of cosmic rays in our atmosphere. It is estimated that two aggregates collide fermions, within a distance of Planck length achievable with the current strength of the magnetic field would require a particle accelerator about 1000 light years in diameter to keep track added in the . Even if this were possible, any product of the collision would be immensely unstable and disintegrate almost instantáneamente.Algunos theoretical physicists have suggested that the multiple dimensions posited by string theory could lead to the gravitational interaction. This would effectively reduce the Planck energy, and also that the descriptions of black hole were valid even for very small masses. But this is highly speculative. Other theorists have thought about the basic assumptions of quantum gravity program, where there really is a compelling case to believe in Hawking radiation. These are just the quantum assumptions that guide the crisis Planck mass: in classical general relativity, a black hole could be in principle arbitrarily pequeño.Todo things to say with certainty is that the classical description by general relativity a black hole with a mass less than the Planck mass is inconsistent and incomplete, so these objects could only be described in the context of quantum gravity. == Chance of artificial micro black holes == When started the first large Hadron Collider (LHC) fully functional way (so far only been tested), the first artificial creation of micro black holes from the collision and fusion of subatomic particles (hadrons) are accelerated is considered likely to "almost" the speed c, so fast baryonic matter greatly increases its mass which explains the formation of micro-black holes which would however ephemeral as they find (in proportion to its mass and gravity of that mass) well away from other material bodies to grow. == See also == * black hole * Large Hadron Collider (LHC in articialmente can create these phenomena).
