Cygnus X-1 (abbreviated Cyg X-1) is a very bright X-ray source in the constellation Cygnus. It was discovered in 1964 from an X-ray detector aboard a sub-orbital rocket Aerobee launched from the White Sands Missile Range. Cyg X-1 is highly variable but in hard X-rays (X-rays with energy over 30 keV) is usually the brightest source of heaven [[File:.

As with all X-ray binary, is not the black hole that emits X-rays, but the stuff that is about to fall on him. This matter (gas and plasma) forms an accretion disk orbiting the black hole and reaches temperatures of millions of kelvin.Mediante measure the orbital elements of the system, it has been established that the mass of the compact object is between 7 and 15 times the mass of the Sun As the maximum mass that can have a neutron star is 3 solar masses, it follows that the compact object is a black hole. Indeed, Cyg X-1 is the first case in which it was possible to prove the presence of a hole negro.Se jets of matter also seen extending from astronomical units to several parsecs, which collides with the interstellar medium and leads an arc of the optical emission. To generate this arc, the jet must have a power of 20,000 times the power of our sun.The system is about 8124 years Earth light. == References ==
