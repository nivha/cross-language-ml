NGC 4889 is a giant elliptical galaxy located an estimated population of about 320 million light years and can be seen with amateur telescopes away. It is the brightest member of the Coma Cluster, intrinsically much brighter than the two brightest galaxies in the Virgo cluster (M49 and M87). NGC 4889 is an excellent example of the type of elliptical galaxies tend to occupy the estimated 250000 330000 light years and light years central regions of rich clusters of galaxies, with a bright center and a large diffuse envelope around its diameter, in addition to a rich system of globular clusters, with a population of them has been estimated at around 12,000, there are even smaller galaxies embedded. In December 2011 it was announced that NGC 4889 contains the largest supermassive black hole known, with a mass of 21 billion solar masses (most likely value, and the range of measured masses is between 6 billion and 37 billion solar masses .) NGC 4889 is located in the center of one of the two major subgroups in the Coma cluster-the other is centered on NGC 4874 is split, the second brightest galaxy Coma.-, and she and her subgroup seem be in process and fuse with that of NGC 4874.
