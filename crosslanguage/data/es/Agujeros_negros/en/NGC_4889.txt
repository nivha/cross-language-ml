NGC 4889 is a giant elliptical galaxy located at an estimated rate of about 320 million light years and can be seen with amateur telescopes below. It is the brightest Coma Cluster member intrinsically much brighter than the two brightest galaxies in the Virgo cluster (M49 and M87). NGC 4889 it is an excellent example of the type of elliptical galaxies tend to occupy the central regions of clusters rich galaxies, with a bright center and a huge diffuse around its diameter estimated at between 250000 and 330000 years light years light, in addition to a rich system of globular clusters, with a population of them has been wrapping estimated at about 12,000, there are even smaller galaxies embebidas.En December 2011 it was announced that NGC 4889 contains the largest known supermassive black hole with a mass of 21 billion solar masses (most likely value as the interval mass is measured between 6 billion and 37 billion solar masses.) NGC 4889 is located in the center of one of the two major groups in the Coma cluster, the other is centered on NGC 4874 is split, the second galaxy brightest Coma -., and she and her subgroup appear to be in process and fuse with that of NGC 4874 ==== References == external Links == NGC 4889 (NED).
