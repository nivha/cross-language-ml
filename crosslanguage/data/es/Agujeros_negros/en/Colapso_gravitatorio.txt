thumb | gravitational collapse of a star esférica.El symmetric gravitational collapse is the inward collapse of a stellar body due to the effect of its own gravity to form a black hole. Because gravity is comparatively weaker than the other fundamental forces gravitational colapos only possible with large masses when the effect of the gravitational interaction in the system becomes more important than the effect of other forces. Systems that can undergo gravitational collapse are stars (which can lead to supernovae, neutron stars or black holes) or massive star clusters and globular galaxies cúmulas or its part densa.En a stable body, the compression due gravity is balanced by balancing the internal pressure of the body in the opposite direction (the gravity tends to move the mass of a system, with a low enough angular momentum towards the center of mass of the system). The internal pressure of the pressure consists largely of non-degeneracy of fermions matter. For moderate pressure gas masses of electrons leading to a white dwarf. If the mass exceeds the Chandrasekhar limit then called a white dwarf is not stable and the pressure exerted by the electrons is not enough so that the reaction is given :: \ mbox {p} ^ \ mbox {e} ^ - \ rightarrow \ mbox {n} {\ nu} _ {\ mbox {e}} and electrons and protons disappear leading to a neutron star. There is also a limit for neutron stars and black holes be overcome that expands to completely consume the star forms. == Introduction == The gravitational pressure compresses the material a star and its temperature rises enough to that start nuclear reactions in hydrogen and helium energy generation by nuclear reactions and the star expands somewhat during most of the life of the star maintains a balance with the gravitational tendency to compress the star. At the end of the life of the star's gravity becomes dominant over the forces of thermal origin and can reach the star to contract sharply. According to the characteristics of weight and shape of collapse can lead to the formation of a compact star. These three types of compact stars, in order of least compact to more compact are: White dwarfs supported by degeneracy pressure of electronres * Neutron stars, supported by pressure degeneraicón neutrons and the repulsive interaction neutron-neutron to cut away * black holes, the internal physics is unknown but could be a spatiotemporal large curvature hosting a spacetime singularity (which is nothing but an exotic region of space-time on which conventional physics can not answer anything about its structure) <-.! the collapse to a white dwarf Takes place over tens of Thousands of years, while the star blows off its outer envelope to form a planetary nebula. If it has a companion star, a white dwarf-sized object can accrete matter from a companion star until it Reaches the Chandrasekhar limit, At which point gravitational collapse takes over again. While it seems That Might Might the white dwarf collapse to the next stage (neutron star) They undergo runaway instead charcoal fusion, blowing completely apart in a Type Ia supernova. Neutron stars are Formed by gravitational collapse of larger stars, the remnant of other types of supernova.Even more gigantic stars, above the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit can not find a new dynamical equilibrium With Any Known force opposing gravity. HENCE, the collapse Continues With Nothing to stop it. Once it collapses to its Schwarzschild radius Within, not even light can escape from the star, Therefore it Becomes a black hole. ACCORDING TO theories, at some point later, the collapsing object will reach the maximum possible energy density for a Un certain volume of space or the Planck density (as there is nothing That can stop it). This is Known When the laws of gravity cease to be valid. There are Competing theories as to what Occurs at this point, but it can no longer really be gravitational collapse Considered one at that thought stage.It Might Be That a large neutron star sufficiently It Could exist inside its Schwarzschild radius and Appear like a black hole without having all the mass compressed to a singularity at the center; However, this is a misconception. Within the event horizon, matter Would have to move outwards faster than the speed of light in order to avoid REMAIN stable and collapsing to the center. No physical force can THEREFORE Prevent the star from collapsing to a singularity (at least currently Understood Within the framework of the general relativity, this does not hold for the Einstein-Yang-Mills-Dirac system). A model for nonspherical collapse in General relativity with emission of gravitational waves and matter has-been presented -..> == Collapse star with spherical symmetry == This issue was addressed by Oppenheimer and Snyder in a classic 1939 article These authors studied somewhat idealized case of a spherical star that has no angular momentum. It is known that small deviations from these conditions have the same basic properties, but the collapse of non-spherical distributions with large angular momenta or masses is markedly different. A spherical star without angular momentum to collapse gives rise to a Schwarzschild black hole, while if the angular momentum is important you have a Kerr black hole. == See also == * == References ==== Big Crunch = References === * Oppenheimer, JR, & Snyder, H.
