A black hole Reissner-Nordström static black hole with spherical symmetry and electric charge is defined by two parameters: the mass M and electric charge Q. His solution was acquired in 1918 by the mathematician Hans Reißner and physical Gunnar theoretical Nordstrøm to the field equations of relativity around a massive object electrically charged and devoid of angular momentum. Reissner-holes Nordstrøm are a type of black hole in Kerr-Newman. Geometric description == == The black hole is a Reissner-Nordstrøm isotropic region is bounded by two event horizons: one named without further external event horizon and an inner Cauchy horizon called. These spaces form a perfect sphere, because of the lack of angular momentum, in whose center is a simple spatial singularity, unlike the more general case of a black hole Kerr-Newman singularities which may occur in a ring. The formula determining the relative distance to the respective event horizons depends only on the mass and charge of the hole, in SI units: {{Equation | r = r_ \ pm = \ frac {G} {c ^ 2} \ left (M \ pm \ sqrt {M ^ 2 \ frac {Q ^ 2} {4 \ pi \ epsilon_0 c ^ 2} } \ right) | 1 | left}} where: * R is the distance of each event horizon, * M is the mass, * Q is the electric charge and the sign determines the event horizon in question, with the positive (r_) for the outer horizon and negative (r_-) to the Cauchy horizon. Relationship === load parameter Q and mass M === The values ​​taken by the electric charge and mass are very important in the anatomy of a black hole Reissner-Nordstrøm, because it is their relationship that determines the specific boundary between their event horizons. There are basically three relationships: M> | Q / 2c \ sqrt {\ pi \ epsilon_0} | or, as usual, | Q / 2 \ sqrt {\ pi \ epsilon_0} c ^ 2 |: looks much like the case of the Schwarzschild black hole but with two event horizons within a reasonable distance of each other. * M = | Q / 2c \ sqrt {\ Pi \ epsilon_0} |: in this case the event horizons merge, forming a continuous horizon surrounding the singularity. * M: It is assumed that this case does not exist in nature, because it is not common that the net electric charge divided denominator factor, exceeds the total mass of a body, as this will cancel out leaving the horizons visible the singularity. In addition, there is the so-called cosmic censorship hypothesis, proposed by the mathematician Roger Penrose in 1965, which does not allow the existence of naked singularities in the universe.
