File: Schwarzchild-Metric.JPG | thumb | Geometry apparent ecliptic plane in a system whose central star is a black hole Schwarzschild.Un Schwarzschild black hole or static black hole is one that is defined by a single parameter, the mass M, specifically the Schwarzschild black hole is a region of space-time is bounded by an imaginary surface called the event horizon. This frontier describes a space which not even light can escape, hence the name black hole. This space forms a perfect sphere whose center is the singularity; its radius is called the Schwarzschild radius. The formula for the radius as said depends only on the mass of the hole: {{Equation | r_s = {2GM \ over c ^ 2}, | | left}} where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the hole c the speed of light. The greater the mass of the black hole, which determines the degree of curvature of space-time, the higher the Schwarzschild radius. The geometry of space-time around a Schwarzschild hole or pit is given by the Schwarzschild metric: {{Equation | g =-c ^ 2 \ left (1 - \ frac {2GM} {c ^ 2 r} \ right ) \ mathrm {d} t \ otimes \ mathrm {d} t \ left (1 - \ frac {2GM} {c ^ 2 r} \ right) ^ {-1} \ mathrm {d} r \ otimes \ mathrm {rr d} ^ 2 \ left (\ mathrm {d} \ theta \ otimes \ mathrm {d} \ theta \ sin ^ 2 \ theta \ \ mathrm {d} \ phi \ otimes \ mathrm {d} \ phi \ right) | | left}} This was one of the first exact solutions of the Einstein field equations of general relativity due to the German physicist Karl Schwarzschild. Besides the peculiarities of the metric for r 2 led to the concept of black hole itself. == Description == phenomenological theory of relativity predicts that within a Schwarzschild black hole, a theoretical limit hypersurface appear, such that the closer her the curvature tensor grows and grows without limit. That kind of geometric object known as spacetime singularity, and can be understood as a limit beyond which spacetime can not be modeled within the theory (assuming that near the singularity quantum effects are important). Besides the spacetime region inside the Schwarzschild hole is geodesically incomplete for any temporary geodesic into the hole, which means that a particle in free fall in the last hole a finite time singularity inevitably reach. Currently we have no theory to tell us what exactly happens when a particle reaches the Schwarzschild singularidad.En if this singularity is timelike, if it turns out that the failure to reach a sufficiently small distance from the singularity might lead to the destruction of the particle itself, as is sometimes assumed, then the particles move faster in the hole disappear "volatizadas" later and slower before. This fact fits with the temporary nature of the singularity, unlike a spatial singularity can be understood rather as a locus == Other == black hole, however, there are other more complicated models of black holes. * The Kerr black hole is a black hole in rotation defined not only by its mass but also angular momentum. Said hole has a preferred direction in space and, therefore, no longer isotropic. This is the model that best fits the type of black holes that you can see the result of the collapse of supermassive stars. * The black hole Reissner-Nordstr√∂m hole with a static electric charge and has special properties because not only is formed a gravitational singularity but also a singularity in the electric field generated by the hole. Said hole is also subject to two parameters. This time, mass and charge. The existence of such holes has not been observed but could conceive of the possibility to create them in controlled conditions such as particle accelerators. * Finally there is the black hole Kerr-Newman. This third type of holes are the result of the combination of the two. It would be charged black holes and rotating. These holes depend on the three parameters, mass, angular momentum and load. Furthermore, by rotating movement within it loads which give rise to the generation of a magnetic field would cause.
