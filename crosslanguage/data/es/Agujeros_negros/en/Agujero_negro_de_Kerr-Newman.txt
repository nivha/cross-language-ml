A black hole or Kerr-Newman rotating black hole with electric charge is one that is defined by three parameters: the mass M, angular momentum J and electric charge Q. This solution was obtained in 1960 by mathematicians and Roy Kerr . Erza Newman to the field equations of relativity for electrically charged or conservation of angular momentum massive objects == Introduction == the black hole Kerr-Newman is not isotropic region that is bounded on three areas: Cauchy horizon an external event horizon and ergosphere. Because of conservation of angular momentum, taking the form set is an ellipsoid, which inside which contains a singularity in a ring or torus compressed volume practically zero (otherwise it would be a black hole Reissner-Nordström .) the formula determining the static ergosphere limit depends on the mass, charge, and the angular momentum of the hole: {{equation | r_s = M \ sqrt {M ^ 2 - a ^ {2} \ cos ^ {2 } \ theta - Q ^ 2} | | left}} where: * r_s is ergosphere perimeter, * M is the mass, * a rotation parameter J \ over M where J is the angular momentum, and Q is eléctrica.En load that determines both the edges of their event horizons so: {{equation | r = r_ \ pm = M \ pm \ sqrt {M ^ 2-a ^ 2-Q ^ 2} | | left where r_}} \ pm is the distance of each event horizon, the value of r_ to the external event horizon, and the value of r_-horizon for internal events. == About Q and J in the hole Kerr-Newman == * rotation speed. When the rotational speed tends to be very large, the event horizon is divided into two, generating huge streams of unique address between them, affecting the static limit of the ergosphere, which tackles some photons to be emitted as gamma rays . * Another common phenomenon in such holes, and whose power depends directly on his speed, is the formation of intense magnetic fields and currents perpendicular ionized gas in the accretion disk that swirls around the ergosphere. * on the relationship Q and J to M in the gyromagnetic radio. The values taken by the electric charge and angular momentum are very important in the anatomy of a black hole Kerr-Newman, because it is their relationship that determines the specific boundary between their event horizons and the gyromagnetic radius or magnetic moment dipolar its formula being r_g = {2mm \ over r_g JQ} where is the radius giromagnérico m is the magnetic moment. There are basically three relationships: ** | Q | ^ J <M, here the dipole magnetic moment is higher, which means a slight effect of electro-magnet outside the ergosphere is generated. The event horizons are kept at a safe distance ** |. Q | = M ^ J, in this case the dipole is normal, creating a moderate magnetic field. The event horizons merge into only one that surrounds the singularity in a ring ** |. Q | ^ J> M, this particular case is not the most common, here the effect of the magnetic field is very intense and event horizons disappear leaving the visible uniqueness; this seems to be prohibited by the rule of the cosmic censor devised by Roger Penrose, which does not allow naked singularities. == See also == * Kerr black hole (or Kerr metric).
