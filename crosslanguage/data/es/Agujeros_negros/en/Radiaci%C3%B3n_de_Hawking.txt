Hawking radiation is a type of radiation produced in the event horizon of a black hole and fully due to effects of quantum type. Hawking radiation is named after the British physicist Stephen Hawking who postulated its existence for the first time in 1976 describing the properties of such radiation and getting some early results in quantum gravity. Hawking's work was after his visit to Moscow in 1973, where Russian scientists Yakov Zeldovich and Alexander Starobinsky showed him that according to the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics rotating black holes should create and emit particles. Later Paul Davies and Bill Unruh proved that an observer or accelerated Rindler observer in flat space-time of Minkowski also detect Hawking radiation type. Radiation Source == == One consequence of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle is the quantum vacuum fluctuations. These include the creation, for the briefest of moments, particle-antiparticle pairs from the vacuum. These particles are "virtual," but the intense gravity of the black hole becomes real. Such pairs together disintegrate rapidly returning the borrowed energy for their formation. However, on the edge of the event horizon of a black hole, the probability that a member of the pair is formed on the inside and one on the outside is not zero, so that one of the components of the pair may escape from black hole; if the particle escapes, the energy will come from the black hole. This phenomenon has as consequences the net emission of radiation by the black hole mass and decreased it. According to this theory, a black hole is losing mass at a rate inversely proportional to it due to a quantum effect. That is, some massive black hole, disappears faster than a more massive. Specifically, a black hole of subatomic dimensions, disappear almost instantly. It is noteworthy that the decrease in mass of a black hole Hawking radiation would only be noticeable on time scales comparable to the age of the universe and black holes only microscopic remnants perhaps of the immediate post-Big Bang era. If so, today we could see bursts of very small black holes, it is something that does not have any evidence. Process emission == == A black hole thermalized Hawking radiation emitted as an identical corresponding to a black body temperature distribution T_H. Which, expressed in terms of Planck units becomes: {{equation | T_H = \ frac {\ alpha_H} {2 \ pi} | 1a | left}} Where \ alpha_H \ is a parameter related to the surface gravity of the horizon. Similarly an observer with a uniform acceleration Rindler sees around himself a thermalized radiation associated with a temperature of black body: {{equation | T_r = \ frac {\ alpha_R} {2 \ pi} | 2a | left}} Where \ alpha_R \, is the acceleration in units of Planck obviously expression are identical and formally expressed in units of Planck. If we rewrite the above two equations in conventional units, Hawking radiation for a Schwarzschild hole and Unruh radiation for accelerated observer are: {{equation | T_H = {\ hbar \, c ^ 3 \ over8 \ pi G M k}, \ qquad T_r = \ frac {\ hbar a} {2 \ pi c k} || left}} where: : \ hbar, is the reduced Planck constant. : c is the velocity of light k is the Boltzmann constant G the gravitational constant M is the mass of a black hole. a is the acceleration of the Rindler observer. Applying the above equations to the solar case, if it were to be converted into a black hole, radiation would have a temperature of only 60 nK (nanokelvin). The radiation temperature is significantly lower than the temperature due to the microwave background radiation, which is higher than 2.7 K, so if there is Hawking radiation, this could be undetectable.
