Ie, it represents a small scale replica of the past. == Features == Their common characteristics with quasars are variable radio emission, sometimes in the form of bipolar jets (ie jets symmetrical and opposite field) and accretion disk around a compact object, usually a neutron star or a black hole. In quasars, the black hole is supermassive, meaning it has a mass of millions of solar masses. In contrast, in the case of microquasars the compact object has only a few solares.Los mass microquasars are actually a binary star X-ray a massive normal star and a compact object, which on Earth is also detected radio . The system is gravitationally bound, an object orbiting around each other. When both stars are close enough to each other transfer of matter from the massive star to the compact object occurs due to gravitational attraction. Part of this energy is released in the form of beams of particles traveling near the speed of light, producing spectacular radiation emissions. In some, due to an optical effect on the orientation of the jet with respect to the observer, a superluminal movement, in which the mass of the jet appears to move at a higher speed of light is observed. The accretion disk is detected with a very high brightness in visible light and X-ray discs difference between these objects and accretion quasar is in the accreted mass of the companion proceeds, whereas in the case of mass quasars comes from the surrounding galaxy. == == microquasars study microquasars are very important for the study of relativistic jets. The jets are formed near the black hole, and time scales, ie, the time in which they occur near the same processes are proportional to the mass of the hole. Thus, the process lasting centuries by quasars occur on scales of days to microcu√°sares.Los microquasars are also suspected of contributing to the production of cosmic rays whose origin, almost a hundred years after its discovery, remains one misterio.La journal Nature announcing the discovery on the cover of microquasars (1992) and the first superluminal source in the galaxy (1994). The journal Science published in June 2006 that the candidate called microquasar LS I 61 303 was observed by the MAGIC telescope, revealing gamma-ray emission. This radiation had a very interesting property: the intensity of the gamma ray emission of LS I 61 303 varies with time. Microquasars galactic laboratories are considered to contrast aspects of the theory of general relativity and understanding of physics in the limit of the most intense gravitational fields. == See also == * black hole Supermassive Galaxy * Blazar * active * Jet / jet stuff * quasar ==== References == external Links == * microquasar, The Internet Encyclopedia of Science (in English) at: # X-ray binary microquasar
