The Galaxy 0402 379 is an elliptical galaxy and radio galaxy located in the constellation galaxy Perseo.Esta a binary system of two supermassive black holes whose separation is 24 light years, the minimum directly observed for this type of binary. The total mass of the system is estimated at ~ 1.5 x 108 solar masses. Assuming a mass equal to both its orbital period is 150,000 years. It is thought that these black holes were the nuclei of two different galaxies collided, leaving black holes in orbit between s√≠.Aunque gravitational radiation of the system is not enough for the orbit diminishes and both black holes collide in the near future the discovery of such systems has important implications to find sources of detectable gravitational waves. == See also == * List of galaxies == References ==
