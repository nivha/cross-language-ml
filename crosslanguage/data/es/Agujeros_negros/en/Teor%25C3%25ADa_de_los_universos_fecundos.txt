The fecund universes theory, also called cosmological natural selection is a theory of physicist Lee Smolin, applying criteria similar to those of Darwinian natural selection to cosmology, so that the known universe could be the result of an evolution and a mutation of anteriores.Esta universes theory outlined in the book the life of the cosmos ('the life of the cosmos'), published in 1997 by Oxford University Press. == Scenario == Lee Smolin suggests that the rules of biology apply a cosmic scale, particularly that he called natural selection are considered theoretically cosmol√≥gica.Smolin the collapse of a black hole causes the emergence of a new world from the "other side" of the spacetime singularity, such a universe may have laws, constants and own parameters, something different in the known universe (eg other high propagation speed different from c, other cosmological constant, etc.). Thus, this notion of the universe supposed biologist possible "views" and "mutation" of universes, leading implicit notion of a multiverse. It is considered that such biologicism is not exactly analogous to the reduced biological processes Tierra.La idea of evolution and mutation of universes also implies the existence of universes "more primitive" (simplest case). According to Smolin expressed in The Life of the Cosmos (Cosmos Life), the dominant universes could be those possessing more black holes. == Reviews == is necessary to note that imagined by Smolin is highly speculative and, despite its name, is not strictly speaking a scientific theory, because it lacks evidence and is unable to make predictions that can be experimentally proven. For this reason it has been mainly reviews falsificationist type, in the sense that Smolin predictions can not be proved or contradict, and are therefore not science. These strong objections, he replied that the study of black holes in the known universe can affirm or refute his theoretical views. == See also == * swing * Multiverse Theory of self-reproducing universe == References ==== Biography Reference * == Smolin, Lee: The Life of the Cosmos 1997 ISBN 0-19-510877-X
