X-ray binaries, low-mass binary systems are composed of a compact object (neutron star or black hole) and a companion star on the main sequence and much less than the mass of the Sun, belonging to the spectral type K or M. the companion star fills what is known as Roche lobe and transfers mass of the neutron star or black hole. Once through the Roche lobe, matter from the companion star still revolves too wide orbit to fall into the compact object, which creates a disk of matter called an accretion disk. Through successive collisions, accretion disk fragments are losing speed and are eventually swallowed by the compact object. Collisions cause the fragments heated to temperatures of millions of degrees and generate X-ray
