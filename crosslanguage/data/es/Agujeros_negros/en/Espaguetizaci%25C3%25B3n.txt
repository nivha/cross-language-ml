In astrophysics, spaghettification object is stretching thin and slender forms (like spaghetti) in a very strong gravitational field, due to extreme tidal forces. In the most extreme cases, finding these objects in the vicinity of black holes, stretching is so powerful that no object can stand it, no matter how resistant they are components.
