In theoretical physics, a kugelblitz (German: "ball lightning") is a concentration of light so intense that form an event horizon being locked itself: According to general relativity, if we focus enough radiation in a region determined the concentration of energy can warp spacetime enough to create a black hole (although in this case it would be a black hole whose mass-energy would have been in the original form of radiation rather than in the form of matter). according to the theory of general relativity of Einstein, once an event horizon has formed the kind of mass-energy that created it no longer refers to importa.La idea kugelblitz best known is probably the article John Archibald Wheeler in 1955 "Geons" which explores the idea of creation of particles (or particle toy models) from the curvature of spacetime. Wheeler's article on geons also introduces the idea that the lines of electric charge trapped in the throat of a wormhole could be used to model the properties of a pair of particles cargado.Un kugelblitz is an important element in the novel Frederik Pohl The encounter. == See also == * black hole * Wormhole == References ==== external links ==
