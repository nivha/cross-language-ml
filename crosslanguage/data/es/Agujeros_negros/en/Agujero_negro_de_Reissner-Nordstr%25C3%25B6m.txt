A black hole Reissner-Nordström static black hole with spherical symmetry and electric charge, is defined by two parameters: the mass M and electric charge Q. The solution was obtained in 1918 by the mathematician Hans Reißner and physical Gunnar theoretician Nordstrøm to the field equations of relativity around a massive object electrically charged and devoid of angular momentum. Reissner-holes Nordstrøm are a type of black hole in Kerr-Newman geometry == Description == The black hole Reissner-Nordstrøm is an isotropic region is bounded by two event horizons. Called no more an external horizon events, and another inmate called Cauchy horizon. These spaces form a perfect sphere, due to the lack of angular momentum in the center may find a simple spatial singularity, unlike the more general case of a black hole Kerr-Newman singularities that can occur in the form of formula anillo.La which determines the distance of this with respect to the respective event horizons depends only on the mass and charge of the hole, in SI units: {{equation | r = r_ \ pm = \ frac {G} {c ^ 2 } \ left (M \ pm \ sqrt {M ^ 2 - \ frac {Q ^ 2} {4 \ pi \ epsilon_0 c ^ 2}} \ right) | 1 | left}} where: * r is the distance of each event horizon, the mass M *, * Q is the electric charge and the sign determines the event horizon in question, with the positive (r_) for the outer horizon and negative (r_-) to the Cauchy horizon . === load ratio parameter Q and mass M === the values take the electric charge and mass are very important in the anatomy of a black hole Reissner-Nordstrøm, because it is their relationship that determines the specific boundary between their event horizons. There are basically three relationships: * M> | Q/2c \ sqrt {\ pi \ epsilon_0} | or, as usual, | Q / 2 \ sqrt {\ pi \ epsilon_0} c ^ 2 |: looks much like the case of Schwarzschild black hole but with two event horizons within a reasonable distance of each other * M = | Q/2c \ sqrt {\ pi \ epsilon_0} |:. event for this event horizons merge, forming a continuous horizon surrounding the singularity * M:. assumes that this case does not exist in nature, because it is not common that the net electric charge divided denominator factor, exceeds the total mass of a body, as this horizons vanish leaving visible to singularidad.Además there called cosmic censorship hypothesis, proposed by the mathematician Roger Penrose in 1965, which does not allow the existence of naked singularities in the universe. == See also == * Metric Reissner-Nordström
