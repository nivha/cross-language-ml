Ray binaries, high-mass x is a type of X-ray binaries that consist of a main sequence star much more massive than the Sun, usually a Be star or a blue supergiant, and one that is an object compact, either a black hole or a star neutrones.En this type of X-ray binary accretion of matter is carried by wind. The stellar wind of the primary star is captured by the secondary star, and when it falls on the object, produces x rays. One of the most famous such systems is Cygnus X-1; in it the first stellar black hole was discovered. == See also == * Binary * Binary X-ray x-ray low-mass
