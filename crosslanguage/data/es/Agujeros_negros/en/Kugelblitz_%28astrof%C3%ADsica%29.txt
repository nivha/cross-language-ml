In theoretical physics, a kugelblitz (German: "ball lightning") is a concentration of light so intense that form an event horizon being locked itself: According to general relativity, if we focus enough radiation in a region particular, the concentration of energy can warp space-time enough to create a black hole (although in this case it would be a black hole whose mass-energy the original would have been in the form of radiation instead of as matter). According to the theory of general relativity of Einstein, once an event horizon has formed the kind of mass-energy that created it no longer matters. The reference to the idea of ​​kugelblitz best known is probably the article by John Archibald Wheeler in 1955 "Geons" which explores the idea of ​​the creation of particles (or particle toy models) from the curvature of space-time. Wheeler's article on geons also introduces the idea that the lines of electric charge trapped in the throat of a wormhole could be used to model the properties of a pair of charged particles.
