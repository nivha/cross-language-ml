Visible.Un in light supermassive black hole is a black hole with a mass of the order of millions or billions of masses solares.Estudios scientists strongly suggest that the Milky Way has a supermassive black hole at the galactic center, called Sagittarius A *. It is believed that many, if not all galaxies harbor a supermassive black hole at its center. In fact, one of the most prevalent theories in recent times is to assume that all elliptical and spiral galaxies have at their core a supermassive black hole, which would generate enough gravity to maintain unity. == Introduction == A supermassive black hole has some interesting properties that differentiate it from other less massive: * the average density of a supermassive black hole may be very low, in fact may be less than the density of water if its mass is sufficiently large. This is because the radius of the black hole increases linearly with the mass, so that the density falls as the square of the mass, while the volume is proportional to the radius cubed Schwarschild such that the density satisfies the following proportionality {{equation | \ rho \ propto \ frac {M} {R_S ^ 3} \ propto \ frac {c ^ 6} {G ^ 3 M ^ 2} \ approx6, 177 \ cdot 10 ^ {17} \ left (\ frac {M_ \ odot} {M} \ right) ^ 2 \ \ frac {\ mbox {g}} {\ mbox {cm} ^ 3} | | left}}: Where \ scriptstyle M_ \ odot is the mass of sun and \ scriptstyle M is the mass of the supermassive black hole. The above amount is less than the density of water when the mass exceeds a billion solar masses. * Tidal forces in the vicinity of the event horizon are significantly lower. Since the central singularity is far from the horizon, a hypothetical astronaut traveling towards the black hole center would not experience significant tidal forces to go far into the hole negro.Los black holes of this size can only be formed in two ways: by slow growth of matter (from a stellar size), or directly by external pressure in the first moments of the Big Bang. The first method requires a long period and large amounts of material available for growth Doppler negro.Mediciones hole of matter surrounding the core of neighboring galaxies to the Milky Way, revealing a rapid rotary motion, which is only possible by a large concentration of matter at the center. Currently, the only known object that can contain enough matter in such a small space is a hole negro.En most remote active galaxies, it is thought that the width of the spectral lines is related to the mass of the black hole generated by the activity of the galaxy . was speculated that supermassive black holes at the center of many galaxies, act as "engines" of them, causing their spin, such as Seyfert galaxies and quasars movements. It is believed that Sagittarius A * is the central supermassive black hole in the Milky Way. == == Possible supermassive black holes has not been identified with any certainty supermassive black hole, however, there are a number of stars that are candidates to be considered as such when there is more evidence available: * in May 2004, Paolo Padovani and other astronomers announced the discovery of 30 supermassive black holes outside the Milky Way. Their discovery suggests that there are at least double these black holes than previously thought. * Among the largest supermassive black holes could be a hypothetical hole in the galaxy OJ 287, with an estimated 18 billion mass mass solar, located in the center of the cluster of Phoenix (Phoenix) to 20 billion solar masses, and the NGC 4889 galaxy, whose mass can reach 21 billion solar masses. == References ===== References === * Robert M.
