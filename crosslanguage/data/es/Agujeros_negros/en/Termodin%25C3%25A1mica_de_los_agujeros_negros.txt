The thermodynamics of black holes is the branch of astrophysics developed from the discovery of the analogy between the laws of thermodynamics and some properties of black holes. These studies were undertaken in the 1970s by scientists such as Stephen Hawking, who in turn raised the phenomenon of evaporation of black holes in 1975 by which a black hole is not an absolutely dark body but could issue a small quantity of . == thermodynamics thermal radiation of black holes Analogy == the study of black holes established the so-called no-hair theorem which holds that it is possible to describe these heavenly bodies by only three parameters: its mass M, electric charge Q and angular momentum L. in the absence of angular momentum, a black hole is perfectly spherical, but has an angular momentum, adopt a slightly flattened. Thus, the parameter appropriately describes the structure of the black hole is not the radio, but its surface is understood as the surface of the event horizon that characterizes him. Therefore exist a relationship between the area of the black hole to the three parameters set by the possible teorema.Es calculate how much it varies the area of a black hole if you inyectase either a small amount of matter nonzero \ delta M, and either angular momentum \ delta L or, electric charge \ delta Q: \ delta M c ^ 2 = \ frac {1} {8 \ pi} \ frac {c ^ 2} {G} \ kappa \ delta A \ Omega \ delta LV \ delta Q, where G is the gravitational constant, c the speed of light, and the quantities V, Ω and κ refer respectively to the electric potential in the vicinity of the surface of the black hole, its speed angular rotation (angular momentum deduced and its mass), and what is known as surface gravity, which measures how fast the gravitational field of the black hole becomes infinite according to his proximidad.De the famous equation E = mc2, the left member is identified by a change in energy. For its part, the terms \ Omega \ delta L and V \ delta Q is identified with a variation of rotational kinetic energy and potential energy. This situation is very similar to what happens in thermodynamics, which shows that some of the variation of the internal energy of a system is related to the work of external forces thereto. It is so in the known equation of thermodynamics, {\ rm d} U = \ delta Q \ delta W, the term {\ rm d} U resembles \ delta M c ^ 2 equation of black holes, while \ delta W corresponds to \ Omega \ delta LV \ delta Q if we consider a system that has an electric charge and a moment of inertia. For the analogy between black holes and thermodynamics submit a physical sense, it must be assumed that the term \ frac {1} {8 \ pi} \ frac {c ^ 2} {G} \ kappa \ delta A can be identified with \ delta Q corresponding to the amount of heat supplied to the system according to the standard formula that associates temperature and entropy. To do this, you need to identify the area including the black hole entropy propia.Una a first stage of this approach was completed by Stephen Hawking who showed that during the merger of two black holes, the surface of the resulting black hole will always be greater than the sum of the surfaces of black holes that formed it. Soon after, in 1974, Hawking revealed the phenomenon of evaporation of black holes, showing that a black hole emits radiation proportional to its surface gravity temperature. Thus, identification of equational term \ frac {1} {8 \ pi} \ frac {c ^ 2} {G} \ kappa \ delta A with the term \ delta Q was completed. == Laws of thermodynamics holes black == the results of the study of black hole analogy allows redesigning the set of laws of thermodynamics for this context: {| border = "1" cellspacing = "0" cellpadding = "2" class = "wikitable" | - bgcolor = "# efefef" | Act | | common Thermodynamics | | black Holes | - | Top zero | | the temperature T of a body is the same the same in thermal equilibrium | | the surface gravity κ is constant over the entire surface of the black hole | - | First principle | | {\ rm d} U = T {\ rm d} S {\ rm work \; adduced} | | \ delta M c ^ 2 = \ frac {1} {8 \ pi} \ frac {c ^ 2} {G} \ kappa \ delta A \ Omega \ delta LV \ delta Q | - | Second principle | | δ S is positive in all transformation involving a closed system | | δ a is positive in all transformation involving black holes | - |. third principle | | is impossible to obtain T = 0 by a physical process | | is impossible to obtain κ = 0 (black hole end) by a physical process |} The first zero of thermodynamics it is an immediate consequence of the properties of the surface gravity which is constant over the entire surface of the black hole. This property may be counterintuitive since for a rotating planet, the gravitational field strength is inferior in Ecuador than at the poles due to the centrifugal force. As we see, this effect is not present in black holes where more precisely, the rate of divergence of the gravitational field intensity when approaching the area is constante.El third thermodynamic principle applied to black holes states that can not reach the end state of black hole, the boundary between a black hole and naked singularity. One conclusion that, for example, if the electric charge of a black hole could be seen to disappear increase their horizon. However, to provide energy to the charged particles should be launched against the black hole of the same charge would become increasingly larger as we approach the end state. Also emerge the phenomenon of creation of pairs of particles-antiparticles in your neighborhood, the black hole will tend to produce pairs among them, those who have opposed the hole charge will be absorbed by it, while the opposite will be repelled. James M. Bardeen (son of double Nobel Prize in Physics John Bardeen), Brandon Carter and Stephen Hawking were researchers who formalized the principles of thermodynamics applied to black holes in 1973, two years even the discovery of the entropy of the holes black by Hawking. Previously, an elegant formula to associate all the thermodynamic quantities was established by Larry Smarr. In honor of its discoverer this formula is known as Smarr formula. == == Statistical Interpretation One of the open questions in the field of thermodynamics of black holes is the interpretation of entropy. There is the possibility that a theory of quantum gravity could provide a viable interpretation of entropy associated with black holes in terms of microstates. Although string theory allows an interpretation for some classes of extremal black holes, for the rest of their complexity not allowed to be described by the same theory to a quantum level. Similarly, loop quantum gravity suggests an interpretation of entropy but only for the type of Schwarzschild black hole, since its reasoning employed can not seem to consistently extended to other black holes. == == Subsequent development prospects the application of techniques thermodynamics of black holes makes evident a set of rich phenomena in black holes. In particular, it is possible to calculate the specific heat of black holes. The Australian physicist Paul CW Davies in 1977 showed that the specific heat diverges as 1 / (T - T_ {\ rm c}) for certain configurations that reach a critical temperature T_ {\ rm c} depending on the parameters of the black hole. Such behavior is typically interpreted in terms of a phase transition of the second order. It therefore seems possible that such phenomena are present in a microscopic interpretation of the entropy of black holes. == Notes ==== References == * Robert M.
