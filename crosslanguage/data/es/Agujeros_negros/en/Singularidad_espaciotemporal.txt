A singularity, informally and from a physical point of view, can be defined as a region of space-time where you can not define a physical quantity related to the gravitational fields, such as curvature, or other. Numerous examples of singularities appear in realistic situations in the context of General Relativity on solutions of Einstein's equations, among which include the description of black holes (such as the Schwarzschild metric) or description of the origin of the universe (Robertson-Walker metric.) from the mathematical point of view, adopting a definition of singularity can be tricky, because if we think of points in the metric tensor is not defined or is not differentiable, we are automatically talking points that do not belong to spacetime. To define a singularity we find the traces that these excluded items left in the fabric of spacetime. We can think of several kinds of strange behaviors. * Temporary Geodetic (or no) that after a proper time (or similar parameter) can not be extended (what is called incompleteness geodesic causal) * Values of curvature that are arbitrarily large near . the excluded point (what is called curvature singularity) == types == singularities singularities may, in its broader aspects; * De coordinates. They result from choosing a bad coordinate system. Some of these coordinate singularities indicating yes yes physical places are special. For example in the Schwarzschild metric, the coordinate singularity at r = 2GM \, \! represents the event horizon. * Physics. Spacetime singularities are void. It differs in the coordinate because some of the contractions of the curvature tensor, this diverges (R_ {\ mu \ nu \ rho \ lambda} R {\ mu \ nu \ rho \ lambda} \, \!, R_ {!. \ mu \ nu} R ^ {\ mu \ nu} \, \, etc) Geometrically physical singularities can be: * open hypersurfaces: This type of singularity can find black holes which have not preserved the angular momentum as for a Schwarzschild black hole or black hole Reissner-Nordstrøm * closed hypersurfaces. toroidal as uniqueness or ring-shaped, usually makes its appearance in black holes that have retained their angular momentum, such as the for a black hole or Kerr black hole Kerr-Newman field here, due to rotation, leave a space forming a medium similar to that of a character structure rosquilla.Según physical singularities can be: * oddities temporary, such as found in a hole in the Schwarzschild a particle ceases to exist certain time instant; depending on your speed, the fast particles take longer to reach the singularity while the slower disappear before. This type of singularity is inevitable, because sooner or later all particles must cross the temporal singular hypersurface. * Space Oddities, like that found in Reissner-Nordstrom hole, Kerr and Kerr-Newman. When spatial hypersurfaces a particle can escape from them and therefore it is evitables.Según singularities visibility for asymptotically inertial observers away from the black hole region (Minkowski spacetime) can include: * naked singularities: there are cases in black holes where due to high loads or speeds, the area around the singularity disappears (ie the event horizon) leaving it visible in the universe we know. It is assumed that this case is barred by the rule of the cosmic censor, which states that every singularity must be separate from space. * Eccentricities within black holes. In other words, the material is compressed to occupy a small or singular unimaginable region whose density is within infinite. That is, everything that falls into the event horizon is swallowed, devoured by a point that could be called "no return" and this is so that not even light can escape this celestial phenomenon. You can not escape because the force of gravity is so great that not even light traveling at 300,000 km / s get it. And according to the theory of relativity of Einstein, as nothing can travel faster than the speed of light, nothing can escape. == == Singularities theorems on uniqueness theorems, due to Stephen Hawking and Roger Penrose, predict . occurrence of singularities under very general conditions on the form and features of spacetime === expansion of the universe and Big Bang === the first theorem, which is stated below, seems applicable to our universe; informally states that if we have a globally hyperbolic spacetime expanding, then the universe came into existence from a singularity (Big Bang) a finite time: {{theorem | Theorem 1 Let (M, g) space-time. globally hyperbolic compliant \ scriptstyle R_ {ab} \ xi ^ a \ xi ^ b \ ge 0 for all temporary vectors \ scriptstyle \ xi ^ a (such as would happen if the Einstein field equations is satisfied fulfilling the strong condition energy to matter). Suppose that there is a space Cauchy hypersurface Σ (class and at least C ²) to which the trace of the intrinsic curvature satisfies K \ scriptstyle 3 / | C |. In particular, all temporary geodesic to the past are incomplete.}} The above theorem is therefore the mathematical statement that under the conditions observed in our universe, which is valid Hubble's law, and assuming the validity of the theory general relativity the universe must start somewhere. === black holes and singularities === the following theorem relates the occurrence of "trapped surfaces" in the presence of singularities. Since a Schwarzschild black hole, and presumably with similar geometries holes, trapped surfaces occur, the following theorem predicts the occurrence of singularities in the interior of a very broad class of surface trapped holes negros.Una a Riemannian manifold two compact dimensions which has the property that both its causal future and causal past has at every point a negative expansion. It is not difficult to prove that any sphere, any fact contained in a sphere, within the region of black hole spacetime of Schwarzschild surface is a closed trapped surface, and thus a singularity in this region should appear. The statement of this theorem, due to Roger Penrose (1965) is as follows: {{theorem | Theorem 2 Let (M, g) A globally hyperbolic spacetime in which \ scriptstyle R_ {ab} k ^ ak ^. b \ ge 0 for all vectors of light type \ scriptstyle k ^ a (such as would happen if the Einstein field equations is satisfied by fulfilling the strong condition or weak energy condition for the matter of that space-time) . Suppose that there is a spatial Cauchy hypersurface Σ (and class at least C ²) and a trapped surface and θ0 is the maximum value of the expansion on it, if θ0 \ scriptstyle 2 / | \ theta_0 |. }} The existence of a light inextensible geodesic type, implies that there will be a photon leaving the surface after a journey time proportional to 2 / c | θ0 | will encounter a temporary singularity future. Although we do not know the actual physical nature of singularities for lack of a quantum theory of gravity photon or "disappear" or experience a phenomenon associated with the theory of quantum gravity whose nature desconocemos.Para which, the trace of the intrinsic curvature satisfies K <C <0, where C is some constant. So any time curve based on Σ and facing the past can be longer than 3 / | C |. In particular, all temporary geodesic to the past are incomplete. === Conservation area black hole === Although not strictly singularity theorems are a collection of results proved by Hawking (1971) which states that, under of the general theory of relativity: * a related black hole can not disappear or split. So if two black holes collide, after interaction would necessarily fused. * The total area of black holes in the universe is a monotonically increasing function, specifically the area of the event horizon of two holes on collision is greater than or equal to the sum original areas. * the superificie time evolution of a region trapped in a black hole, it will be forever contained in said hole negro.Los previous theorems are important because they ensure that even in real situations where exact calculations are difficult or impossible, the topological properties of a spacetime containing black holes guarantee certain facts, complicated the geometry. Of course we know that in a quantum theory of gravity, the first two results probably are not maintained. Hawking himself suggested that the emission of Hawking radiation is a quantum mechanical process by which a black hole could lose area or evaporate; therefore, the above results are only predictions of the general theory of relativity. == == Occurrence of singularities description of space-time and matter that makes the theory of general relativity of Einstein can not adequately describe singularities. In fact, the general theory of relativity only gives an adequate description of gravitation and space-time scales larger than the Planck length lP :: L_p = \ sqrt {\ frac {\ hbar G} {c ^ 3}} mbox \ approx 10 ^ {-33} \ {cm} Where: \ hbar is the reduced Planck constant, G \, universal gravitational constant, c \, is the velocity of the quantum limit luz.De should be expected to also the theory of relativity no longer appropriate when spatial curvature predicted by lP-2 which happens very close to the singularities of curvature as existing within the various types of black holes. == See also == * Appendix: Glossary of relativity * Penrose-Carter diagram * cosmic Egg == References ==
