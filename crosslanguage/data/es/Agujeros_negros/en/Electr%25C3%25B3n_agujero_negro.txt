In physics, there is a speculative notion that says that if there is a black hole with the same mass and charge as an electron, share many properties including electron magnetic moment and the wavelength. This idea is based on a series of articles published by Albert Einstein between 1927 and 1949. They showed that if the elementary particles are treated as singularities in space-time, it is not necessary to postulate geodesic motion in the framework of general relativity . == Issues == quantum mechanics allows superluminal speeds for such a small object with mass as the electron scales larger than the Schwarzschild radius of the electron away. == == Schwarzschild radius Schwarzschild radius (rs ) of any mass is calculated using the following formula :: r_s = \ frac {c} {2Gm ^ 2} for an electron: * G is the gravitational constant, m * is the mass of the electron = 9.109 × 10-31kg, * c is the speed of a value luz.Esto da: rs = 1.353 x 10-57mAsí if the electron has a radius as small as this, it would become a gravitational singularity. You would then have a number of properties in common with black holes. In the Reissner-Nordström metric, describing black holes with electric charge, a similar amount rq is defined as: r_ {q} = \ sqrt {\ frac {q ^ 2} {G} {4 \ pi \ epsilon_ {0} c ^ {4}}} where q is the charge and ε0 is the permittivity of vacuum for an electron with q =-e = -1.602 × 10-19 C, this gives a value of:. rq = 9.152 × 10, 37mEste value indicates that a black hole electrons would be super extreme and have a naked singularity. Quantum electrodynamics theory treats the electron as a point particle, a view fully supported by experience. In practice, however, the experiments prove particle energy can not arbitrarily large scale, and quantum-based electrodiámica so related to experiment electron radius with a value less than the wavelength of a large mass, of the order 10 ^ 6 GeV, o: r \ approx \ frac {\ alpha \ hbar c} {10 ^ 6 GeV} \ approx 10 ^ {-24} m.Ningún proposed experiment would be able to probe ra values as low as rs or rq, which are smaller than the Planck length. It is believed that a black hole would end Super unstable. In addition, all smaller than the Planck length physics probably requires a coherent theory of quantum gravity. == See also == * Quantum Gravity * end * naked black hole singularity == References == * Burinskii, A., (2005) "the Kerr-electron Dirac. * Burinskii, A., (2007)" Geometry and Kerr space-time structure of the electron Dirac. * Michael Duff (1994) "Kaluza-Klein theory in perspective. * Stephen Hawking (1971) "," Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society 152. 75 * Roger Penrose (2004) the road to Reality: a Complete guide to the laws of the Universe * 'T Hooft G.
