Hawking radiation is a type of radiation produced in the event horizon of a black hole and fully quantum effects due to type. Hawking radiation is named after the English physicist Stephen Hawking who postulated its existence for the first time in 1976 describing the properties of such radiation and getting some early results in quantum gravity. Hawking's work was after his visit to Moscow in 1973, where Russian scientists Yakov Zeldovich and Alexander Starobinsky showed him that according to the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics rotating black holes should create and emit partículas.Posteriormente Paul Davies and Bill Unruh proved that an observer or accelerated Rindler observer in flat spacetime Minkowski also detect Hawking radiation type. == Origin == radiation One consequence of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle of quantum fluctuations are vacuum. These include the creation, for the briefest moments of particle-antiparticle pairs from the vacuum. These particles are "virtual," but the intense gravity of the black hole becomes real. Such pairs together quickly decay returning the borrowed energy for their formation. However, on the edge of the event horizon of a black hole, the probability that a member of the pair is formed in the inside and one on the outside is not zero, so that one of the components of the pair may escape from black hole; if the particle escapes, the energy will come from the black hole. This phenomenon has as consequences the net emission of radiation by the black hole and the mass decrease éste.Según this theory, a black hole loses mass at a rate inversely proportional to it, due to a quantum effect. I mean, a little black hole disappear faster than a more massive. Specifically, a black hole of subatomic dimensions, disappear almost instantáneamente.Cabe mention decreasing mass of a black hole Hawking radiation would only be noticeable on time scales comparable to the age of the universe and only in microscopic black holes perhaps remnants of the period immediately following the Big Bang. If so, now could see bursts of very small black holes, it is something that does not have any evidence. == == A process for issuing black hole emits Hawking radiation thermalized according to an equal distribution of body black corresponding to a temperature T_H. Which, expressed in terms of Planck units becomes: {{equation | T_H = \ frac {\ alpha_H} {2 \ pi} | 1a | left}} Where \ alpha_H \, is related to the severity parameter horizon surface. Similarly Rindler observer with a uniform acceleration perceived around themselves a thermalized radiation associated with a temperature of black body: {{equation | T_r = \ frac {\ alpha_R} {2 \ pi} | 2a | left}} Where \ alpha_R \, is the acceleration in units of Planck obviously formally expression and are expressed in units identical Planck.Si rewrite the above two equations in conventional units, Hawking radiation for a Schwarzschild hole and Unruh radiation for an observer accelerated are: {{equation | T_H = {\ hbar they \, c ^ 3 \ over8 \ pi k GM}, \ qquad T_r = \ frac {\ hbar a} {2 \ pi ck} | | left}} where :: \ hbar is the reduced Planck constant. c is the speed of light, k is Boltzmann's constant G the gravitational constant, M is the mass of a black hole. a is the acceleration of the observer Rindler.Aplicando the above equations to the solar case, if it were to be converted into a black hole, radiation would have a temperature of only 60 nK (nanokelvin). This radiation temperature is significantly lower than the temperature due to the microwave background radiation, which is higher than 2.7 K, so if there is Hawking radiation, this could be undetectable. == See also == * Thermodynamics black hole quantum gravity == * ==== Reference external links == * http://library.thinkquest.org/C007571/english/advance/english.htm (English) * calculation tool Hawking radiation (in English) * the case of mini black holes A. & J.
