The holographic principle is an improved and promoted by Leonard Susskind in 1995 speculative conjecture about quantum gravity theories proposed in 1993 by Gerard 't Hooft, and. Postulates that all information contained in a particular volume of a space could be found from the codified information on the border of the region. An important consequence is that the maximum amount of information that can contain a given region of space surrounded by a differentiable surface is limited by the total area of said superficie.Por example, can model all the events occurring in a room or room creating a theory in which only take into account what happens in your walls. In the holographic principle also states that for every four units of Planck there is at least one degree of freedom (or unit Boltzmann constant k of maximum entropy). This is known as Bekenstein border: {{equation | S \ le \ frac {A} {4} | | left}} where S is the entropy and A is the unit of measurement considered. In conventional units the above formula is written: {{equation | S \ le \ left (\ frac {kc ^ 3} {G \ hbar} \ right) \ frac {A} {4} = k \ frac {A} {4 \ ell_P ^ 2} | | left}} where: * k \,, is the Boltzmann constant * c \, is the speed of light * G \,, is the constant of gravitation *... \ hbar \,, is the rationalized Planck constant. * \ ell_P \,, is the Planck length. == Relationship between the holographic principle and structure of the universe == in a larger and more speculative sense, the theory suggests that the entire universe can be seen as an information structure in two dimensions "painted" on the cosmological horizon, such that the three dimensions we observe only be effective at macroscopic scales and at low energies description; so then the universe would actually be a hologram. The holographic principle has not been done yet mathematically precise, partly because the cosmological horizon has a finite area and grows with time. == Explanation == Given any finite compact region of space, for example a sphere inside no matter and energy. If the energy exceeds a critical density, the theory of general relativity predicts that the region will collapse into a black hole (or black hole). Theoretically, the resulting black hole has entropy. The latter follows from the work of J. Bekenstein and S. Hawking in the 1970s, which showed that the entropy is proportional to the surface area of the event horizon of the black hole. Various physical arguments, establish that black holes are objects of maximum entropy and the entropy contained in a region of "space" can not be greater than the entropy of the largest black hole that can fit in such a volume. This limit is known as border Bekenstein.El "event horizon" of a black hole enclosing a volume. Obviously, the event horizons of black holes more massive are larger and contain higher volumes. The most massive black hole that can fit in a given region is one whose event horizon corresponds exactly to the border of the given region. A greater mass of a hole implies that the hole will have higher entropy. Therefore, the upper limit of the entropy of an ordinary space region is directly proportional to the surface area thereof and not to their volume. But this result is counterintuitive, because the entropy is an extensive quantity, so be expected to be directly proportional to the mass, which is proportional to the volume (with all else equal, including bulk density) . If the entropy of ordinary mass (not just black holes) is also proportional to its surface area implies that somehow the volume itself is illusory: the mass occupying area, not volume, and then the universe is actually a hologram, which is isomorphic to the information recorded on its borders. Juan Maldacena's work suggested that in QCD there are real systems that fully meet this holographic property, which is interpreted by Susskind and other proponents of the holographic principle as evidence for quantum gravity could also submit that property. == information density limit == Considered as information, entropy ultimately can be quantified in bits or nats. A nat corresponds to about 1.44 bits, and four units of Planck [3]. The total number of bits relates to the total of degrees of freedom of matter / energy. The same bits encode information about the states that matter is occupying / energía.En a given volume no greater than the density of the information about the place of all the particles that make up matter in that volume limit. Suggesting that matter itself can not subdivide countless times, there must be an ultimate level of fundamental particles. Ie, one composed subparticles particle degrees of freedom of each particle would be the product of all degrees of freedom of its subpartículas.Si subparticles these are also divided into sub-particles (infrapartículas), and so on indefinitely, the degrees of freedom of the original particle should be infinite, which violate the maximum entropy density. The holographic principle thus implies that the subdivisions must stop at some level, and that the fundamental particle is a bit (1 or 0) of the information.The more rigorous implementation of the holographic principle (until 2009) is the AdS / CFT correspondence Juan Maldacena. However, JD Brown and Marc Henneaux showed rigorously, and in 1986, that the asymptotic symmetry of 2 1 g dimensions leads to a Virasoro algebra, whose corresponding quantum theory is a theory of "two-dimensional conformal field '. == Summary == you have to understand the holographic principle as a cube, or as room, as described in the introduction. If a cube is represented in a coordinate axis would be three squares. Each electric charge particle, angular moment, etc.. All this is not representable mathematical values in three, but in many more axes. That would be the aforementioned information partícula.También is understood that when the density of such information is enormous just be a black hole (information / too much particles defined by space): more info more event horizon, or outer limit the black hole. As such, the information can be broken into bits, and these bits are reflected in a Planck unit. == See also == * Singularity * Shape * universe * Sacred Geometry * Fractal Universe holonomic quantum mechanics * = * Simulated Reality = References References === * ===== Leonard Susskind: the War of the black Holes.
