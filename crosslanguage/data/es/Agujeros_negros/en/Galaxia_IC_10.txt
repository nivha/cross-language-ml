The IC 10 galaxy is a galaxy belonging to the Local Group and is in the constellation Cassiopeia. It is a dwarf galaxy is at a distance of 1.8 million light-years approximate. Due to its characteristics and dimensions resembles the so-called Small Magellanic Cloud, and its distance to Andromeda, which is the same as the existing Triangle-perhaps a part of the "M31 subgroup." == Classification == is another of dwarf called galaxy and this is due to its relatively small mass. This is checked by telescopic observations made by researchers or by satellite observations through espaciales.El most notable feature of this object is to be the closest galaxy to ours starburst; density of Wolf-Rayet stars is much higher than that of the Large Magellanic Cloud and the Small Magellanic Cloud == Astronomical Discovery ===== IC 10 X-1 === 700px |. thumb | Artist's impression of greater stellar black hole discovered in the galaxy 30-10-2007 IC 10 (Photo: NASA).. the galaxy IC 10 particularly stands at the moment, because it was found in it (by scanning through two satellites sent into space by NASA) on October 30, 2007, the biggest stellar black hole known to the present and ranging in size from 24 to 33 times the mass of Sol.Cabe noted that to date the record was held by the hole dimension black star that was discovered on 17 February of the same year, in the M33 galaxy, whose mass equals 16 times that of the Sun == References ==== See also == * Annex: List of constellations constellation Cassiopeia * == external Links == *****
