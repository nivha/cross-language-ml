In theoretical physics, a black hole is a black hole end with the least possible mass that can be compatible with the electrical load and moment angular.En theories of supersymmetry, extreme black holes are often supersymmetric, ie are invariant under various supercharges. This is a consequence of the BPS bound. Such black holes are stable and do not emit Hawking radiation. His black hole entropy can be calculated from string theory. The electron hypothetical black hole is defined as a black hole end. == See also == * black hole Hawking Radiation * String Theory * == External Links == * Extremal Black Holes pdf (English) * RN Extremal Black Hole (in English) * N = 2 extremal black holes pdf (English) == References ==
