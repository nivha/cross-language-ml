A black hole or Kerr rotating black hole is a region of black hole present in the Kerr space-time, where the mass object has a radius of less than a certain magnitude above this radius universe Kerr no region black hole. A Kerr black hole is a non-isotropic region is bounded by an event horizon and ergosphere presenting notable differences from the Schwarzschild black hole. This new frontier describes a region where light can still escape but whose turn induces high energy photons in the cross. Because of the conservation of angular momentum, this space is an ellipsoid, in whose interior is a single event horizon with its respective singularity due to rotation that is ring shaped. The Kerr spacetime corresponds to the gravitational field produced by a mass body of mass M and angular momentum J. This solution builds on the success of the mathematician to solve the equations of relativity around a massive rotating object. Training == == A Kerr black hole is formed by the gravitational collapse of a rotating massive star, or the collapse of a collection of stars or gas with a zero total angular momentum. Since most of the stars rotate, it is expected that most of the holes in nature are rotating black holes. In late 2006, astronomers reported estimates of the speed of rotation of a black hole in the Astrophysical Journal. A black hole in the Milky Way, GRS 1915 105, can rotate 950 to 1150 times per second, which is close to the theoretical upper limit. Kerr Universe == == A universe is a pseudoriemanniana Kerr spacetime variety or where the Einstein field equations in vacuum are verified using the Boyer-Lindquist coordinates is given by: {{equation | ds ^ 2 = - \ left (1-\ frac {2GMr} {c ^ 2 \ Sigma} \ right) c ^ 2 dt ^ 2 - \ frac {4aGMr \ sin ^ 2 \ theta} {c ^ 3 \ Sigma} cdtd \ phi \ frac {\ sigma} {\ Delta} dr ^ 2 \ Sigma d \ theta ^ 2 \ left (r ^ 2 \ frac {a ^ 2} {c ^ 2} \ frac {the 2nd ^ 2Mr \ sin ^ 2 \ theta} {c ^ 4 \ Sigma} \ right) \ sin ^ 2 \ theta d \ phi ^ 2}} where: * \ Sigma = r ^ 2 \ frac {a ^ 2} {c ^ 2} \ cos ^ 2 \ theta, * \ Delta r ^ 2 = \ frac {c} {2GMr ^ 2} \ frac {a ^ 2} {c ^ 2}, * M is the mass of the rotating object mass, * A parameter that describes the relative speed of rotation, which is related to the angular momentum J by the ratio a = J / M, and * C the speed of light and G the constant of gravitation. Ergosphere === === The area forms the border of the ergosphere is called static limit. The ergosphere defines an area in which observers can not remain static: their reference systems are inevitably dragged by the rotation of spacetime. However, this area is intermediate between the outside and the event horizon, so observers can stay or leave this area without necessarily falling into the singularity. Its boundary is given by: {{equation | = {{r_s} \ frac {GM} {c ^ 2} - \ frac {a ^ 2} {c ^ 2} \ cos ^ {2} \ theta} \, \! }} where: * Rs is the perimeter of the ergosphere, * M is the mass and * A is the ratio J / M (where J is the angular momentum). Before == static limit and beyond ... == * Outside the ergosphere is generated, should have a companion star, another area called accretion disk, where the interstellar matter is attracted by the strong curvature of the black hole, reaching swirls around intense energies. It has been speculated that this may lead to intense electric currents whose flow would lead to a powerful magnetic field that would act as a giant electromagnet generated. * Among the ergosphere and the event horizon, a region must-direction, which inevitably attracts all objects in it are, and whose turbulence is huge due to the rotation of the black hole is formed. Already in the inner edge or boundary of the event horizon, nothing escapes the gravitational force generated by the singularity .. == The possibility of time travel == Everything in the universe revolves, so it is unlikely that Schwarzschild black holes exist. If an object to be absorbed by a Schwarzschild black hole, there would be no way to avoid the singularity. When the object reaches the singularity is flattened to zero infinite density and volume, and the mass of the object is added to the black hole. In the case of rotating black holes, however, may avoid the singularity. A ship entering the black hole must match the direction and speed of rotation of the black hole. By doing this, it will be possible "whirling" around lethal uniqueness and leave the black hole in a different part of space-time. It may seem absurd that the ship can leave the black hole itself, since it would require an infinite speed. However, the rotating black hole distorts space-time singularity to be avoided, and that the ship can leave the black hole at reasonable speeds. The rotation of the black hole also warps space-time with the creation of two event horizons, rather than one as Schwarzschild black holes. The direction of rotation of the black hole may or may not affect whether the ship is moving forward or backward in time. However, the ship can not leave the black hole in a different time and the same point in space. The black hole can be connected to another region of the universe by a black hole, so that the complete metric act as a wormhole. Just as nothing can escape a black hole, nothing can enter a white hole. (The existence of white holes is doubtful, since it seems to violate the second law of thermodynamics.) This implies that a ship going by a rotating black hole can get white hole in a different region of space-time, some believe that this would allow time travel. The main problem with this option is that there is no black hole near the Earth. The nearest black hole appears to be in the binary star system V4641 Sagittarii. The distance that was originally thought to be 1600 years Earth light, but recent calculations have shown that much further. For the long distances that have to be covered is not expected within our technological reach in the foreseeable future. There are other issues that must also be overcome. For example, a rotating black hole mass of 10 solar masses, with a diameter of 2.7 kilometers, only allows navigation within 600 meters. A stellar black hole supernova remnants is about 2 kilometers in diameter and only allows navigation within 30 meters. Another problem is how fast you turn the black hole, since black holes can not be seen directly, there is no way to know the angular velocity. The black hole can also turn to relativistic speeds, it would not be easy to get in and out of the black hole. As explained above, the rotating black hole can rotate GRS 1150 1915 105 times per second, which is about 98.5% of the speed of light. To calculate the approximate diameter of a black hole, first, care must be taken that the original mass of the collapsing star must be taken into account. If the star does not reach the standard limits to collapse into a black hole, then only a white dwarf or neutron star. The formula is: {{equation | \ text {4GM} \, \ over \ text {c} ^ 2 \}!} where: * G is the gravitational constant (6.673 × 10-11), * M is the mass of the original star, and * C is the speed of light. For a massive star reaches a state of black hole in the distant future, you must have a mass of at least three times the mass of stellar black hole sun. Because the mass of the Sun is 1.99 × 1033 g, the mass of the star would be 5.97 × 1033 grams. Substituting into the equation, we have: {{equation | {{\ text {4GM} \, \ over \ text {c} ^ 2}} = {{4 (6.673) (10} ^ {- 8}) (5.97) (10 ^ {33 }) \ over \ text {9 (10 ^ {20}})} = 17.7 \ · 10 ^ 5 \ \ text {cm} = \ text {17.7} \ \ text {km} \!}} wherein expression of 9 × 1020 represents the square of c, measured in centimeters per second. This solution, however, is only the diameter of the black hole. The waterway opening is considerably smaller, only 180 meters. The mass of the original star compared to the Sun is proportional to the waterway opening by a factor of 60 meters. Therefore, if the Sun became a black hole in the distant future, there would be a waterway opening of 60 meters. Thus, even in very massive stars, the waterway opening is very small compared to the diameter of the black hole. If the ship was larger than the waterway opening, is bound to meet with the singularity and collapse to zero volume and infinite density.
