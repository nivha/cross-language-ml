GRS 1915 105 is a binary system composed of a star and a black hole. It was discovered on August 15, 1992, by the Soviet spacecraft Granat. "GRS" means "Granat Source", "1915" is the right ascension (19 h, 15 min), and "105" is the decline: 10.5 degrees. His counterpart was confirmed by NIR spectroscopic observations. This system is located about 11,000 parsecs away, or about 40,000 light years away in the constellation Aquila. GRS 1915 105 is the heaviest known stellar black holes so far in the Milky Way, with 10 to 18 times the mass of the Sun. It is also a microquasar, and it seems that the black hole can turn 1,150 times per second. History == == GRS 1915 105 became, in 1994, the first known source in our galaxy which ejects material as superluminal, ie, at speeds exceeding that of light. Observations with high resolution telescopes such as radio VLA, MERLIN and VLBI show a bipolar output flow of charged particles, which emit synchrotron radiation at radio frequencies. These studies have shown that the apparent superluminal motion is due to an effect known as relativistic relativistic aberration where the intrinsic rate is actually ejected material to 90% the speed of light. Growth regulation == == The observations of the Chandra X-ray Observatory during the period of a decade have revealed what may be a mechanism of self-regulation of the growth rate of GRS 1915 105 The stream of material being ejected at times drowned by a hot wind blowing from the accretion disk. The wind deprives the jet of materials needed to sustain it. When the wind dies down, the jet material returns.
