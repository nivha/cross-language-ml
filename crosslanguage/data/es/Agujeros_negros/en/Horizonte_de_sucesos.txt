In general relativity, the event horizon, also called event-horizon refers to a boundary hypersurface of spacetime, such that events on one side of it can not affect an observer on the other side. Note that this relationship need not be symmetrical or bijective, ie, if A and B are the two regions of space-time in which the event horizon divided space A can not be affected by the events in B, but B events themselves are generally affected by the events in A. to give a concrete example, the light emitted from one side of the event horizon can never reach an observer at the other lado.Existen various types of event horizons and these may occur in different circumstances. One particularly important happens in the presence of black holes, but this is not the only type of possible event horizon, there also Cauchy horizons, Killing horizons, horizons particle or cosmological horizons. == Event Horizon of a hole black rotary == thumb | Scheme of the event horizon and the event horizon ergosferaEl is an imaginary spherical surface surrounding a black hole, in which the escape velocity necessary to move away from it matches the speed of light . Therefore, nothing in it, including photons, can escape due to the attraction of an extremely intenso.Las gravitational field outside particles that fall within this region never come out again, because to do so would require an escape velocity greater than that of light, and so far, the theory is that nothing can alcanzarla.Por therefore there is no way to look inside the event horizon, or transmit information to the outside. This is the reason why black holes have no visible external features of any kind, for determining its internal structure or its contents, it is impossible to establish in what state is the art from that beyond the event horizon until it collapses into negro.Si center of hole we fell into a black hole, at the time of crossing the event horizon would not notice any change as it is not a material surface, but an imaginary border, away from the central area where mass concentration. The peculiar feature of this border is representing the point of no return, beyond which there can be no other event than fall inward, thus giving rise to the name of this superficie.Al include quantum effects in the event horizon, the emission of radiation by the black hole horizon == accelerated observer is made possible due to the vacuum fluctuations that give rise to the so-called Hawking radiation. == Other different horizon is that which is seen by an observer uniformly accelerated. To characterize this type of horizon we need to introduce Rindler coordinates for Minkowski spacetime. From the Cartesian coordinates the metric of the space-time: Consider now the region known as "Rindler wedge", given by the set of points that verify: {{equation | \ mathcal {R} _ {Rind} = \ {(T, X, Y, Z) \ in \ R ^ 4 | 0 | | left}} and define thereon a change of coordinates given by: {{equation | t = \ operatorname {arctanh} (T / X), \; x = \ sqrt {x ^ 2-T ^ 2}, \; y = Y, \; z = Z | | left}} Whose inverse transformation is given by: Using these coordinates Rindler wedge of Minkowski space has a metric expressed in the new coordinates given by the expression: This metric has an apparent singularity at x = 0, where the tensor expressed in Rindler coordinates on has a determinant which vanishes. This happens because in x \ rightarrow 0 acceleration associated with the observer becomes infinite. In these coordinates the Rindler horizon is precisely the boundary Rindler wedge. Interestingly, it can be shown that this horizon is analogous in many respects to the event horizon of a black hole. == Horizonte in the observable universe == The edge of the observable universe is a hypersurface which is the barrier which can be observed at each instant of time, beyond which light particles exist has not yet had time to reach us, because the age of the universe is finite (see Big Bang). A current or past event located behind the event horizon, not part of the current observable universe (although it may be visible in the future when the light signals coming from them reach our future position.) The way this horizon of the observable universe changes depending on the nature of the universe's expansion. If the expansion has certain characteristics, which will never be observable, for example, no matter how much time passes (that happens to some type of accelerated expansion, for example). The last frontier of events that can never be observed is properly called an event horizon event horizon part√≠cula.El criterion for determining whether the event horizon of the universe is different from emptiness is the following, define one d_E comoving distance by expression: {{equation | d_E = \ int_ {t_0} ^ \ infty \ frac {c} {a (t)} dt \ | | left}.} in this equation, a (t) is the scale factor, c is the speed of light and t0 is the current age of the universe. If d_E \ rightarrow \ infty, ie arbitrarily distant points can be observed, then the event horizon is empty. If d_E \ neq \ infty then exist sucesos.Ejemplos horizon models without cosmological event horizon are universes models dominated by matter or by radiation. An example of model with cosmological event horizon is a universe dominated by the cosmological constant, such as a de Sitter universe. == Event Horizon and topology == The study of causality in general relativity is carried out following a topological approach, and a horizon of future or past events can be characterized as the set of points in the topological closure of the domain of dependence of a light hypersurface located at "infinity" that do not belong to the past or chronological future of that domain. Should clarify that when we say that a hypersurface is located in the "infinity" means that is located on plot points representing Penrose conformal spacetime, in signs horizons past events H ^ - (\ mathcal {S} _L) and future H ^ (\ mathcal {S} _L) of a light hypersurface \ mathcal {S} _Lvienen given by Equation {{| H ^ - (\ mathcal {S} _L) = \ overline {D ^ - (\ mathcal {S} _L)} - I ^ (D ^ - (\ mathcal {S} _L)) \ qquad H ^ (\ mathcal {S} _L) = \ overline {D ^ (\ mathcal {S _L})} - I ^ - (D ^ (\ mathcal {S} _L)) | | left}} Where the definition of signs that appear is the same used in glossary of relativity == See also == * Hole. . * black * ergosphere naked spacetime singularity Singularity * Schedule *:... * Glossary of relativity. w: Event Horizon Telescope (in the English Wikipedia).
