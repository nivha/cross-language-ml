In general relativity, the event horizon of events-also called horizon refers to a hypersurface boundary spacetime, such that events on one side of it can not affect an observer on the other side. Note that this relationship does not need symmetric or bijective be, that is, if A and B are the two regions of space-time in which the event horizon divides the space, A can not be affected by the events in B, but B events themselves are generally affected by the events in A. to give a concrete example, the light emitted from one side of the event horizon can never reach an observer on the other side. There are various types of event horizons, and they may appear in different circumstances. One particularly important happens in the presence of black holes, but this is not the only possible event horizon, and there are also Cauchy horizons, Killing horizons, horizons particle or cosmological horizons. == Event Horizon of a black hole rotating == thumb | Scheme of the event horizon and the event horizon ergosferaEl is an imaginary spherical surface surrounding a black hole, in which the escape velocity necessary to move away from it matches the speed of light. Therefore, anything within it, including the photons can escape due to the attraction of an extremely intense gravitational field. Foreign particles that fall within this region never come back, because to do so would require a speed exceeding that of light escape and, so far, the theory states that nothing can reach it. Therefore, there is no way to look inside the event horizon, or transmit information to the outside. This is the reason why black holes have no visible external features of any type, to determine its internal structure or its contents, it is impossible to establish in what state is the art from that goes beyond the event horizon until it collapses the center of the black hole. If we fall into a black hole, at the time of crossing the event horizon would not notice any change, since it is not a material surface, but an imaginary border, away from the central area where the mass is concentrated. The peculiar feature of this border is representing the point of no return, beyond which there can be no other event than fall inward, thus giving rise to the name of this area. By including quantum effects in the event horizon, it becomes possible emission of radiation by the black hole due to the vacuum fluctuations that give rise to the so-called Hawking radiation. Skyline == == accelerated observer Another different type of horizon is that it is viewing a uniformly accelerated observer. To characterize this type of horizon we need to introduce Rindler coordinates for Minkowski spacetime. Starting from the Cartesian coordinates the metric of the space-time: Consider now the region known as "Rindler wedge", given by the set of points that verify: {{equation | \ mathcal {R} _ {Rind} = \ {(T, X, Y, Z) \ in \ R ^ 4 | 0 || left}} And on it we define a change of coordinates given by: {{equation | Â  t = \ operatorname {arctanh} (T / X), \; x = \ sqrt {X ^ 2-t ^ 2}, \; y = Y, \; z = Z || left}} Whose inverse transformation is given by: Using these coordinates Rindler wedge of Minkowski space has a metric expressed in the new coordinates given by the expression: This metric has an apparent singularity at x = 0, where the tension expressed in coordinates on Rindler has a determinant which vanishes. This happens because in x \ rightarrow 0 acceleration associated with the observer becomes infinite. In these coordinates the Rindler horizon is precisely the boundary of the Rindler wedge. Interestingly, it can be shown that this horizon is analogous in many respects to the event horizon of a black hole. Horizon == == in the observable universe The edge of the observable universe is a hypersurface which is the barrier of what can be observed in each time step, particles exist beyond which light has not had time to reach us, because the age of the universe is finite (see big Bang). A current or past event located behind the event horizon, not part of the current observable universe (although it may be visible in the future when the light signals coming from them reach our future position). The way that this horizon of the observable universe changes according to the nature of the universe's expansion. If the expansion has certain characteristics, which will never be observable, for example, no matter how much time passes (this happens in some kind of accelerated expansion, for example). The last frontier of events that can never be observed is properly called an event horizon event horizon particle. The criterion for determining whether the event horizon of the universe is different from emptiness is the following, define one D_e comoving distance by the expression: {{equation | D_e = \ int_ {t_0} ^ \ infty \ frac {c} {a (t) dt} \. || left}} In this equation, a (t) is the scaling factor, c is the speed of light and t0 is the current age of the universe. If D_e \ rightarrow \ infty, ie arbitrarily distant points can be observed, then the event horizon is empty. If D_e \ neq \ infty then exist an event horizon. Examples of cosmological models without event horizon are universes dominated by models of matter or radiation. An example of a cosmological model with event horizon is dominated by the cosmological constant, such as a de Sitter universe Universe. Event Horizon == and == topology The study of causality in general relativity is carried out following a topological approach and a horizon of future or past events can be characterized as the set of points in the topological closure of the domain of dependence of a hypersurface light located in the "infinite" not belong to the past or chronological future of this domain. Should clarify that when we say that a hypersurface is located in the "infinite" is meant that is located on plot points representing Penrose conformal spacetime, in signs horizons past events H ^ - (\ mathcal {S} _L) and future H ^ (\ mathcal {S} _L) of a light hypersurface \ mathcal {S} _Lvienen given by: {{Equation | H ^ - (\ mathcal {S} _L) = \ overline {D ^ - (\ mathcal {S} _L)} - I ^ (D ^ - (\ mathcal {S} _L)) \ H qquad ^ (\ mathcal {S} _L) = \ overline {D ^ (\ mathcal {S} _L)} - I ^ - (D ^ (\ mathcal {S} _L)) || left}} Where the definition of the signs that appear is the same used in glossary of relativity.
