thumb | 230px | The ergosphere would be the region where the Penrose process Penrose.El process could occur (also called Penrose mechanism) is a theorized by Roger Penrose process by which you can extract energy from a rotating black hole. This extraction is made possible because the rotational energy of a black hole is not located inside the event horizon, it is in an outer region surrounding the hole called ergosphere. In this region a particle is necessarily driven by locomotor concurrence with rotating spacetime. All objects in the ergosphere are drawn into a space-time rotational. In this process, if a material object enters the ergosphere of a black hole is halved. The timing of both pieces of material may be such that a part escape to infinity, and some fall through the event horizon into the hole. The part that escapes can possibly have more matter-energy as the original part that came into the ergosphere, so that the energy balance is negative. In summary, the process results in a decrease in the angular momentum of the black hole, and therefore a corresponding reduction in energy transfer point where the loss of energy becomes extra√≠da.El process obeys the laws of thermodynamics of black holes . One consequence of these laws is that if the process is repeated continuously, the black hole could eventually lose its angular momentum and become a non-rotating black hole. Demetrios Christodoulou calculated an upper limit for the total amount of energy that could be extracted by the Penrose process. == Details == References ==== * ergosfera Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler, Gravitation, Freeman and Company, 1973 . * Energetics of the Kerr-Newman Black Hole by the Penrose Process; Manjiri Bhat, Sanjeev Dhurandhar & Naresh Dadhich; J.
