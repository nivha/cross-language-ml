The Schwarzschild radius is the measure of the size of a Schwarzschild black hole, ie, a black hole static spherical symmetry. It corresponds to the apparent radius of the event horizon, expressed in Schwarzschild coordinates. Since the size of a black hole depends on the energy absorbed by it, the greater the mass of the black hole, the greater is the Schwarzschild radius, which is given by: {{equation | r_s 2 G = {M \ over c ^ 2}}} where: * G is the gravitational constant, * M is the mass of the object and * C is the speed of light. This expression was found in 1916 by Karl Schwarzschild and constitutes part of an exact solution to the gravitational field formed by a non-rotating star with spherical symmetry. The Schwarzschild solution was found the first exact solution for the equations of general relativity. The Schwarzschild radius is proportional to the mass of the object. The Schwarzschild radius for the mass of the Sun is 3 km while the Schwarzschild radius for an object of the land mass would be only 8.8897 mm. The Schwarzschild radius for the supermassive black hole at the galactic center is approximately about 7.8 million kilometers.
