Dark matter is baryonic dark matter composed of baryons, such as eg protons and neutrons and, in general, any type of dark matter and baryons containing other particles attached to them. The baryonic dark matter candidates are non-luminous gases, compact and massive objects in galactic halos (MACHOs) and dwarf marrones.La total amount of baryonic dark matter can be calculated from the big bang nucleosynthesis, and observations of the cosmic microwave background. Both indicate that the amount of this material is much less than the total amount of matter oscura.En nucleosynthesis case, the problem is that a large amount of normal matter means a dense young universe, namely, the efficient conversion of matter helium-4 and less deuterium remaining. If we assume that all the dark matter of the universe is composed of baryons we, then there are far more deuterium in the universe. This can be resolved if there is any way to generate deuterium, but efforts have been made since the 70 with negative results, generalizing the idea that this element can not be created.
