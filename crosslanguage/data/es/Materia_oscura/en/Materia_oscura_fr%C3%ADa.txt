Cold dark matter or CDM (cold dark matter in English) is one of the types of dark matter proposed in the early 1980s to explain the formation of cosmic structure in the Big Bang model. Starting with a certain distribution for the initial fluctuations, the way these are amplified and grow depends on the characteristics of materia.Modelos only baryonic matter had not predicted the observed structure properly, and that it was known that the amount of matter baryonic was very low. In models with hot dark matter formed by particles moving at high speed (hence "hot"), the fluctuation at small scales were "erased" by movement of hot particles. In that case the first structures to form superclusters would be of dimensions, Zeldovich pancakes, which then frangmentarían, giving rise to a structure formation "top-down" (top-down). With cold dark matter, however fluctuations on small scales are not deleted, and matter collapses starting with small scales (smaller than galaxies), and then increasingly larger scales in training "bottom up" (bottom-up). According to this model, at the present time the matter is still collapsing on scales of clusters. For over a decade the cold dark matter was the favorite, and the computer simulations favorecían.Sin But in the late twentieth century, as computer simulations are made more detailed, cold dark matter began to have problems explaining the structure subgalácticas scales. == See also == * hot ** dark Matter dark Matter dark Matter ** warm * Lambda-CDM model modified Newtonian dynamics * References == Bibliography ===== * ===
