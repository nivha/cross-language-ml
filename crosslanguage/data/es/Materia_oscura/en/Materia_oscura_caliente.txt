Hot dark matter is a type of dark matter would consist of particles traveling at speed relativista.El more likely candidate for hot dark matter is neutrino.Los neutrinos have negligible mass, no electrical charge and therefore virtually not interact with matter, which makes them incredibly difficult to detect. These same characteristics, is also what makes them good candidates for dark matter caliente.La hot dark matter, however, can not explain how individual galaxies formed from the Big-bang background microwave radiation, as has been measured by the COBE satellite is uniform and can not be explained as the fast-moving particles would be added from this initial state. To explain the structure of the universe, cold dark matter is necessary. Hot dark matter is currently discussed as a part of the mixed theory of dark matter. == See also == * Dark Energy Dark Matter *
