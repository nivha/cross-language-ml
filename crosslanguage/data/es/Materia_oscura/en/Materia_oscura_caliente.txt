Hot dark matter is a type of dark matter would consist of particles traveling at relativistic speed. The most likely candidate for the hot dark matter is the neutrino. Neutrinos have negligible mass, no electrical charge and therefore hardly interact with matter, which makes them incredibly difficult to detect. These same characteristics, is also what makes them good candidates for hot dark matter. Hot dark matter, however, can not explain how individual galaxies formed from the Big Bang. The microwave background radiation, as has been measured by the COBE satellite is uniform and can not be explained as the fast-moving particles would be added from this initial state. To explain the structure of the universe, cold dark matter is required. Hot dark matter is currently discussed as a part of the mixed theory of dark matter. See also == == * Dark Matter * Dark Energy
