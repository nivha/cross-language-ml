Anais detection experiment designed to detect particles of dark matter. Find the annual modulation signal with NaI scintillators and has as main goal, the direct detection of galactic dark matter through its dispersion with the target nuclei of a crystal of NaI (Tl) radiopuro. This signal should be modulated Dark Matter annually due to the change of the relative velocity WIMP-nucleus, due to the rotation of the Earth around the sun.The ANAIS project is the culmination of previous large-scale feasibility studies carried out with different prototypes for the research group at the University of Zaragoza in Canfranc Underground Laboratory (Spain). The entire experiment will use 250 kg of crystal NaI (Tl) ultrapure to study the annual modulation signal galactic dark matter. Two prototype detectors with a total mass of 25 kg. data taken from October 2012 as the last step before mounting completo.Los experiment experimental efforts DAMA / NaI and DAMA / LIBRA in the Gran Sasso National Laboratory, accumulating over thirteen annual cycles of data (also with NaI scintillators ) obtained a positive signal for said annual modulation. Comparing this result with the negative results from other target materials and other experimental techniques is highly dependent on the model used. ANAIS (using the same white material and the same experimental technique DAMA / LIBRA) appeared in the latest roadmap ApPEC (Astroparticle Physics European Coordination) as the experiment that would verify this result with an independent experimental setup and in a manner independent of model. ==== References == external Links == * ANAIS * Underground Laboratory Experiment Canfranc
