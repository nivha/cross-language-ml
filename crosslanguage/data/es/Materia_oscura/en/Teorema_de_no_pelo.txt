The no hair theorem theorem theorem no hair or baldness (English translation no hair theorem) postulates that all black hole solutions described in the Einstein-Maxwell equations of gravitation and electromagnetism in general relativity can be characterized by only three externally observable parameters: mass M, the charge Q and angular momentum J.Toda other information about the matter that forms the black hole or is falling into it, disappears behind the event horizon and is permanently inaccessible to an outside observer (paradox of black hole formation) American physicist John Archibald Wheeler (1911-2008), who in 1968 coined the term "black hole" -. expressed this idea with the phrase "black holes have no hair "(that is, there are more), which gave rise to the name of this teorema.El end state of the black hole is independientedel body which contracted ode the stuff that came from the shape of the original body (whether this spherical or irregular), its magnetic field Yde all other physical properties. * Hole * black * white Hole worm Hole * black hole Kerr black hole * Kerr-Newman black hole * Reissner-Nordstr√∏m * Schwarzschild black hole * Penrose diagram * neutron Star * active * elliptical galaxy M87 Galaxy * History of Time (Hawking book) * Magnetar * black * astronomical object microhole * Holographic Principle * Pulsar * Hawking Radiation * naked * Karl Schwarzschild Singularity Theory * fecund universes == References ==
