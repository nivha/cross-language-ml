Dark matter is baryonic dark matter composed of baryons, such as eg protons and neutrons and, in general, any kind of dark matter and baryons containing other particles attached to them. The baryonic dark matter candidates are non-luminous gases, compact and massive objects in galactic halos (MACHOs) and brown dwarfs. The total amount of baryonic dark matter can be calculated from big bang nucleosynthesis, and observations of the cosmic microwave background. Both indicate that the amount of this material is much less than the total amount of dark matter. For nucleosynthesis, the problem is that a large amount of normal matter means a dense young universe, namely, the efficient conversion of matter to helium-4 and less remaining deuterium. If we assume that all the dark matter of the universe consists of baryons, then there is much more deuterium in the universe. This can be solved if there was any way to generate deuterium, but efforts have been made since the 70 with negative results, generalizing the idea that this element can not be created.
