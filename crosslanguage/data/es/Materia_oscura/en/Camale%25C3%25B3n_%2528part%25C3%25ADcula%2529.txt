The "Chameleon" is a hypothetical scalar particle with a nonlinear self-interaction which gives it an effective mass dependent on the environment, the presence of other fields. You could have a small mass in most of the intergalactic space but its mass would increase the closer you are to a source of gravitational field, so that their detention is complicada.El chameleon is a possible candidate to solve the problem of dark energy and dark matter. == == hypothetical Properties in most theories, chameleons has a mass approaches a power density of local energy ::::: m_ {eff} \ sim \ rho ^ \ alpha where \ alpha \ simeq 1.The chameleons can be coupled to photons, allowing both particles oscillate together in the presence of a magnetic field externo.Los chameleons can be confined in containers empty because its mass increases rapidly as they traverse container walls, causing the reflection. One way is to experimentally find chameleons direct photons inside a cavity, confining chameleons produced, and then turn off the light source. The presence of a residual luminescence would indicate that, in the cavity, have decayed chameleon photons again. == == Experiments Several experiments have attempted to detect and axiones.El GammeV chameleon axions experiment aims, but also has been used to search chameleons. The experiment consists of introducing a cylindrical chamber in a magnetic field of 5 T. In each end of the chamber, there are glass windows which allow entry of the laser light and the output of the luminescence residual.Los latest results of these experiments were published in November 2010, but found nothing. == References == ***
