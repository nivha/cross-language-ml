The axino is a hypothetical elementary particle predicted by some theories of particle physics. The Peccei-Quinn theory attempts to explain the observed phenomenon known as the big problem CP introducing a hypothetical scalar particle called axion. Adding supersymmetry model predicts the existence of a fermionic superpartner for the axion, the axino, superpartner boson and the Saxion. They are grouped in a superfield quiral.Seg√∫n such theory, the axino would be the lightest supersymmetric particle. Because of this property, among others, is considered a candidate for him or one of the components of dark matter == See also == * Chirality (physics) * Supersymmetry Supergravity * == References == * Saxion...
