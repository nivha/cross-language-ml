Sterile neutrinos are a hypothetical type of neutrino that does not interact through any of the fundamental interactions of the Standard Model except gravity. It is a light right handed or left handed neutrino antineutrino that can be added to the Standard Model and partake of some phenomena such as neutrino oscillation. The search for these particles is a very active area in particle physics. == == Motivations Experimental results show that (almost) all produced and observed neutrinos are left-handed with helicity (antiparallel spins all the time and antineutrinos are helicity clockwise within the margin of error. in the limit massless means that only one of the two possible chiralities is observed for both particles. these are the only helicities (and chirality) included in the standard model of particle interactions. the Standard Model predicts there are only these neutrinos.Recientes experiments such as neutrino oscillation have shown, however, that neutrinos have nonzero mass, which is not predicted by the Standard Model and suggests a new and unknown physics. This unexpected mass explained neutrinos with right-handed helicity or left-handed. since they do not move at the speed of light, its helicity is not relativistically invariant (may move faster than them and observe the opposite helicity) However, all observed neutrinos have left-handed chirality and all right-handed antineutrinos. Chirality is a fundamental property of particles and is relativistically invariant: it is the same regardless of the speed and mass of the particle in any frame of reference. The question therefore remains: Can neutrinos and antineutrinos be differentiated only by the chirality? Or right-handed and left-handed neutrinos antineutrinos exist as separate particles? == Properties? ===== ======= Mass Particle Dirac or Majorana? ======= Mechanism Saw === detection Attempts == See also == * ==== LSND (Liquid Scintillator Neutrino Detector at LANL) * MiniBooNE at Fermilab ==== References == external Links == * The NuTeV experiment at Fermilab * The L3 Experiment at * CERN Neutrino Experiment Nixes Fourth (April 2007 Scientific American)
