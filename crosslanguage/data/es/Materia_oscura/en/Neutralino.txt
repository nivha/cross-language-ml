The neutralino is a hypothetical elementary particle type and electrically neutral fermion which appears in some versions of the theories or models of supersymmetry particles. The standard symbol for neutralinos is N0 1 (the lightest), N0 2, N0 3 and N0 4 (the heavier) but occasionally also represented by \ tick {\ chi} ^ 0_i (chi), where i ranges from 1 to 4. In cosmology, the neutralino is considered a possible WIMP, and therefore a good candidate to solve the problem of dark matter. According to supersymmetry, the supercompa√±eras Z boson (zino), the photon (photino) and Higgs (higgsino) all have the same quantum numbers, so are mixed to form neutralinos. Virtually undetectable, only interacts through gravity and the weak interaction, presenting no electric or color charge. It is a fermion and if it exists and is stable (which is unknown), you could have a mass ranging between 30 and 5000 GeV / c ^ 2.
