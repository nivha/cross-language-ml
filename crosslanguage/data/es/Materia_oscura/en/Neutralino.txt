The neutralino is an electrically neutral fermionic type hypothetical elementary particle which appears in some versions of the theories or models of supersymmetry particles. The standard symbol is N01 neutralinos (the lightest), N02, N03 and N04 (the heaviest) but occasionally also represented by \ tick {\ chi} ^ 0_i (chi), where i is 1 to 4. in cosmology, the neutralino WIMP is considered possible, and therefore a good candidate to solve the problem of matter oscura.Seg√∫n supersymmetry, the superpartners of the Z boson (zino), the photon (photino) and the Higgs boson (higgsino) all have the same quantum numbers, so are mixed to form neutralinos. Virtually undetectable, only interacts through gravity and the weak interaction, presenting no electric or color charge. Is a fermion and if it exists and is stable (which is unknown), you could have a mass ranging between 30 and 5000 GeV / c ^ 2.
