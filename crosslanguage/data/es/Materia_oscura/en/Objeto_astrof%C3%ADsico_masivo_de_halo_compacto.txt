In astrophysics are called MACHOs (his acronym: Massive astrophysical compact halo object) or massive astrophysical object compact halo to either type of astronomical bodies that can be used to explain the presence of dark matter in galactic halos, ie , is a general call massive objects difficult to detect. A MACHO is a small object of baryonic matter moving through interstellar space in isolation (it is not associated with any solar system) and emits little or no radiation. Failure to emit its own light makes them very difficult to detect. While meeting these characteristics within the category of MACHOs can enter different types of objects, from black holes or neutron stars to brown dwarfs and isolated planets, even been proposed as a very faint white dwarf and red dwarf MACHOs. It is a type of dark matter proposed in the big bang theory would help explain the gravitational behavior of galaxies, both individually and within clusters. The main way of detection is by male microlensing ie apparent to capture variations in sizes of bright objects behind as MALE mass deflects light. Although some authors in the Milky Way could represent 20% of all matter, the observations indicate that such objects can not fully explain the cosmological problem of the absence of matter.
