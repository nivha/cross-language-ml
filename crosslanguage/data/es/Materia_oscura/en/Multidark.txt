[http://projects.ift.uam-csic.es/multidark/MULTIDARK] is a project funded by the Spanish Consolider-Ingenio 2010 program of the Ministry of Science and Innovation (reference CSD2009-00064). Its aim is to combine the efforts of experimentalists and theorists, astrophysicists and cosmologists in order to identify and detect dark matter. It began operation in January 2010 and runs for five years. With simple gravitational arguments, one can deduce that most of the matter in the universe, 85%, is not bright and of unknown origin. It is, surprisingly, we are not made ​​of the same type of material as the rest of the Universe. Have been proposed many elementary particles as candidates to explain dark matter. Since it is known that the known particles do not serve as candidates, the existence of dark matter implies that the existing laws of physics must be modified. This is the case for example of the supersymmetric extension of the standard model of particle physics predicts possible candidate particles like the neutralino, the sneutrino or the gravitino. The project seeks to identify MULTIDARK particle (or particles) responsible (s) of the dark matter. To this end, members of the project set out to analyze in detail the most plausible candidate particles, formed to investigate how galactic halos of dark matter and contribute to the development of experiments that detected.
