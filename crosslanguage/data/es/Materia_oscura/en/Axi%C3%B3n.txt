The axion is a peculiar subatomic particle. His existence (yet unproven) was postulated by the theory of Peccei-Quinn in 1977 to explain the conservation of CP symmetry in the framework of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), assuming it would be a particle of very small mass and no electric charge .'s name was introduced by Frank Wilczek, co-writer of the first article that predicted the axion. Wilczek was looking for a name for the particle, and while washing clothes, noticed the name of the detergent I was using, "Axion", and decided to put that name to the particle, and expected to "clean" the problem of QCD CP.En cosmology with symmetry, the axion is considered a good candidate to solve the problem of dark matter. It is also speculated that under certain circumstances, may temporarily converted photons into axions, which would explain why the high-energy photons can travel long distances in the universe without being absorbed radiation fondo.A late 2006, Jain and Gurmukh Singh Piyare reported the discovery of a particle of mass unexpectedly large (6-20 MeV) and very limited life (about 10-13 seconds) that could be the sought recent axi√≥n.Estudios have theorized that axions exist, they would have a particularly light weight, less than 10-7 eV. This feature drastically reduce your chances of being part of the dark matter, as is expected to be heavier. ==== References == External Links == * December 6, 2006 news article by PhysicsWeb.org * July 17, 2006 news * Scientific American article from March 27, 2006 news article by PhysicsWeb.org * November 24, 2004 news article by PhysicsWeb.org * CAST * CAST Experiment at MPI / MPE...
