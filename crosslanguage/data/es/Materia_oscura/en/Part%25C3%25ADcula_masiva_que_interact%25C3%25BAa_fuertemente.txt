Massive particles strongly interact SIMP for its acronym in English (Strongly interacting massive particle) are hypothetical particles that interact strongly with ordinary matter, but could form the dark matter despite ello.Las strongly interacting massive particles have been proposed as a solution to the problem of cosmic rays of very high energy and for the absence of cooling flows. Several experiments and observations have established restrictions for dark matter SIMP.D. Javorsek II, E. Fischbach and V.
