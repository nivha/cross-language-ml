VIRGOHI21 is a galactic halo of dark matter located in the Virgo Cluster, 60 million light years from the Milky Way. It was discovered through studies of neutral hydrogen in the cluster having a mass between 100 million and 10 billion solar masses. From this mass, just one-hundredth is in the form of gas.Este object does not appear to have stars, or if you are very slim; a study by the Hubble Space Telescope found only 129 giant stars rojas.VIRGOHI21 seems to have interacted with the galaxy M 99, being responsible for the peculiar form of one of its brazos.Sin But others think that their existence is doubtful and another galaxy that has been responsible for the appearance of the galaxy M 99, HI21 VIRGO being simply the remains of the meeting between the two. == References == * http://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/nph -objsearch? objname = Virgo HI21 & extend = no & out_csys = Equatorial & out_equinox = J2000.0 & obj_sort = RA or Longitude&of=pre_text&zv_breaker=30000.0&list_limit=5&img_stamp=YES*http://space.newscientist.com/article/dn12100-dark-galaxy-continues-to-puzzle-astronomers.html*http://www.pparc.ac.uk/Nw/d_galaxy2.asp*http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.1586*http://arxiv.org/abs/0707.0113*http://cdsads.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?2008ApJ...673..787D&db_key=AST&nosetcookie=1
