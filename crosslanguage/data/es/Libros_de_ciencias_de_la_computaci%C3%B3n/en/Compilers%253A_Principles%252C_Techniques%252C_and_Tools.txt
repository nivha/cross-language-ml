Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools (. Translated Compilers Principles, techniques and tools), better known as The Book of the Dragon (Dragon Book in English) to appear a dragon on the cover (which represents a compiler) A book is reference in the world of compilers and interpreters languages by Alfred V. Aho programación.Escrito, Monica S. Lam, Ravi Sethi and Jeffrey D. Ullman also the book became famous in the world of developers compilers. in August 2006 the second edition was published. It so necessary algorithms for processing languages such as LR (Left-to-rigth-most-derivation Rigth) or LL (1) (Left-to-rigth-Left-most derivation 1) that underlie treated modern compilers. == == first Edition the first edition of the book informally called red dragon to distinguish it from the second edition and Principles of compiler design (Principles of design Compiler) of Aho and Ullman (1977, sometimes known as . the "green dragon book" because the dragon on the cover is green) a new edition of the book was published in August 2006.Los topics covered in the first edition include: * Structure * compiler lexical analysis (including regular expressions and finite) automata * Analysis of syntax (including context-free grammar, parser LL, Bottom-up parsing and parser LR) * directed translation * syntax check of types (including type conversion and polymorphism) * Scene runtime (including parameter passing, symbol table, and storage allocation) * code generation (including intermediate code generation) * Optimization second Edition == code == Following in the tradition of its two predecessors, the second edition has a dragon and a gentleman on the cover; For this reason, the book series is commonly known as the dragon books. The different editions of the series are further distinguished by the color of the dragon. This second edition is informally known as the purple dragon. Monica S. Lam Stanford University became a co-editor of this edición.La second edition includes several additional topics that were not covered in the first edition. New topics include: * Translation * directed flow analysis * new data * Compiling parallel machines just in time (JIT) * Garbage collection * New case studies See also == * == * Compilers * Programming Language Book * Book Wizard Principles of Compiler Design == external Links == * Book Website at Stanford with link to Errata * Sample chapters from the second edition.Categoría: Books informáticaCategoría: CompiladoresCategoría: Theory of programming Languages
