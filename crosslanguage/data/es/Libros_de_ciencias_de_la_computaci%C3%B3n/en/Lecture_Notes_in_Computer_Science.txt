Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) is a series of books of computer science that have been published by Springer Science Business Media (formerly Springer-Verlag) since 1973.LNCS publishes research results in computer science, especially in the form of minutes (or proceedings), post-proceedings and research monographs. Additionally, tutorials, summaries of the state of the art and "hot topics" (subjects with high demand) are being increasingly included. Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI) and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics (LNBI) are two sub-series of LNCS.El editorial team for LNCS was originally placed in Heidelberg, Germany, but much of the work has been delegated to India. Since 2008, there have been more than 5,000 LNCS volumes and an online subscription to the complete series costs nearly 23,000 euros per year. LNCS is considered one of the largest series of conference proceedings in computer science, along with the ACM, IEEE and USENIX. ==== References == External Links == * Official Site * Information LNCS SpringerLink * cryptography LNCS Volumes * Category: Organizations based in 1973Categor√≠a: Books of computer science
