The Art of Computer Programming (in Castilian, "The art of computer programming ') is a comprehensive monograph written by Donald Knuth that is about analysis of algorithms programación.Knuth initiated the project in 1962, originally conceived as a single book 12 chapters. The first three volumes (of the expected seven) were originally published in 1968, 1969 and 1973, respectively. The first installment of the volume 4A (a booklet paperback) was published in 2005, and the hardcover version in 2010 Knuth has planned to provide additional installments every two years == * == Volumes Volume 1 -..
