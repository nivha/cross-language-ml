The Human Interface Guidelines (HIG) are documents which offer application developers a set of recommendations aimed at improving the user experience, making interfaces more intuitive, learnable, and constant use. Most guides are limited to define a common look and feel for applications, and focus on the uses on a particular desktop environment. The guides list specific policies sometimes based on studies of the Human-Computer Interaction (or in usability studies) but most are based on arbitrary conventions chosen by the developers of the Human Interface Guidelines plataforma.Las indicate a set of rules generally useful. Often describe visual design rules, including icon design, and style windows. Specify how often will the input mechanisms and the interaction of these with HIG usuario.Un sometimes defines standard terminology and semantics related to certain elements or actions. This is usually restricted to the semantics of the desktop environment or system archivos.El HIG main objective is to create a strong and consistent experience in the environment in which applications (typically an operating system or a desktop environment unfold ). This means that applications have one common visual design and interface elements - some simple, such as buttons and icons to more complex, such as construction diálogo.Las boxes HIGS be construed as a recommendation to important in helping developers create better applications, but developers are naturally free to break these rules if they think the guidelines set by the HIG not fit in certain uses. Sometimes the decision to avoid suggestions of HIG in interface design can bring negative impact within the organization that publishes it, as if the interface used in the Mozilla Firefox web browser, which it goes against the GNOME HIG project, which is why the decision to include Firefox instead of epiphany in the distribution of this desktop environment. == Examples == * HIG Windows Vista User Experience Guidelines * Apple OS X Human Interface Guidelines * Apple iOS Human Interface Guidelines * GNOME Human Interface Guidelines * Indie HIG * Java Look and Feel Design Guidelines * Java Look and Feel Design Guidelines: Advanced Topics * GuidelinesCategoría KDE User Interface: Interface usuarioCategoría: Computer Books
