Principles of Compiler Design (Principles of Design Compiler), is a classic book on compilers for programming languages computer written by Alfred Aho and Jeffrey D. Ullman.A often called "the dragon book" because its cover is a knight and a dragon in battle; the dragon is green, and is labeled "Complexity of Compiler Construction", while the knight wielding a spear labeled "LALR parser generator". The book can be called "green dragon book" to distinguish it from its successor, the book Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools (Compilers: Principles, Techniques and Tools) by Aho, Sethi and Ullman, which is "the book of red Dragon "because the dragon on the cover is red. The second edition of Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools added a fourth author, Monica S. Lam, and the dragon became purple; . thus becoming "the purple dragon book 'by The back cover provides a humorous view on different problem - the dragon is replaced by windmills, and the gentleman is Don Quijote.Hoy days, Principles of Compiler Design is quite dated, but when it came out in 1977, it was acclaimed for its practical bent; treatments included all phases of the collection, algorithmic sufficient detail that students could build their own small compilers in semestre.El book was published by Addison-Wesley, ISBN 0-201-00022-9. The surveys mentioned that the book was entirely composed using troff Bell Laboratories in the Unix operating system, which at that time had been little seen outside laboratories == See also == * Compilers.
