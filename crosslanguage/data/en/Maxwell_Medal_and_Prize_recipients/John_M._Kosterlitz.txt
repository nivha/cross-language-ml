'''John Michael Kosterlitz''' is a professor of physics at [[Brown University]].

J. Michael Kosterlitz, a native of [[Aberdeen]] in Scotland, is the son of the biochemist [[Hans Walter Kosterlitz]]. He received his B.A. and M.A. at [[Cambridge University]]. In 1969 he earned a D.Phil. at [[Oxford University]]. After a few postdoctoral positions, including stays at the [[University of Birmingham]], collaborating with [[David Thouless]], and at [[Cornell University]], he was appointed to the faculty of the [[University of Birmingham]] in 1974, first as a lecturer and, later, as a reader. Since 1982, he is professor of physics at Brown University.

He does research in [[condensed matter]] theory, one- and two-dimensional physics; in [[phase transitions]]: random systems, electron localization, and [[spin glasses]]; and in critical dynamics: melting and freezing. 

Michael Kosterlitz was awarded the [[Maxwell Medal and Prize]] from the British [[Institute of Physics]] in 1981,and the [[Lars Onsager Prize]] from the [[American Physical Society]] in 2000, especially, for his work on the [[Kosterlitz-Thouless transition]]. Since 1993, he is a Fellow of the [[American Physical Society]].
