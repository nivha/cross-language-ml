'''Richard Henry Dalitz''' (28 February 1925 &ndash; 13 January 2006) was an [[Australia]]n [[physicist]] known for his work in [[particle physics]].<ref name=Close2006/><ref name=AitchisonEtal2008/>

Born in the town of [[Dimboola]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], Dalitz studied physics and mathematics at [[Melbourne University]] before moving to the [[United Kingdom]] in 1946, starting his PhD research at the [[University of Cambridge]]. After two years he took up a one year post at the [[University of Bristol]], and then joined [[Rudolf Peierls]]' group at [[University of Birmingham]].  Dalitz moved to [[Cornell University]] in 1953. He then became a professor at the [[Enrico Fermi Institute]] in Chicago from 1956 to 1963. Next, he moved to the [[University of Oxford]] as a [[Royal Society]] research professor,<ref>{{cite journal|author=Close, Frank|title=Obituary: Richard Henry Dalitz|journal=Physics Today|date=July 2006|volume=59|issue=7|pages=65–66|url=http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/magazine/physicstoday/article/59/7/10.1063/1.2337841|doi=10.1063/1.2337841}}</ref> although keeping a connection with Chicago until 1966. He retired in 1990. 

==Physics==

At Birmingham he completed his thesis demonstrating that the electrically neutral pion could decay into a photon and an electron-positron pair, now known as a [[Dalitz pair]]. In addition, he is known for other key developments in particle physics: the [[Dalitz plot]] and the [[CDD poles|Castillejo–Dalitz–Dyson (CDD) poles]].<ref name=Close2006/>

Kasmi, Search for the Standard Model Higgs Boson in final states with photons or taus at the Tevatron, PoS (EPS-HEP 2011) 237.</ref> The Dalitz plots were discovered in 1953, while he was at Cornell.

Furthermore, Dalitz was directly involved in pioneering quark research and he participated in the identification of the top [[quark]].<ref name=AitchisonEtal2008/>  His various fundamental contributions have led to practitioners in the field to identify Dalitz as one of particle physics "greatest unsung scientists."<ref name=Close2006/> 

Dalitz was an old and close friend of [[John Clive Ward]], the creator of the [[Ward–Takahashi identity|''Ward Identities'']].<ref>[[F. J. Duarte]], [http://www.opticsjournal.com/AUSTRALIAN%20PHYSICS%2046%286%29%20171-175%20%282009%29.pdf The man behind an identity in quantum electrodynamics, ''Australian Physics'' '''46''' (6), 171-175 (2009)]</ref> Their friendship began around 1948 when Dalitz independently derived Ward's results<ref>M. H. L. Pryce and J. C. Ward, Angular correlation effects with annihilation radiation, ''Nature'' '''160''', 146 (1947).</ref> for the polarization [[quantum entanglement|entanglement]] of two photons propagating in opposite directions.<ref>J. C. Ward, ''Memoirs of a Theoretical Physicist'' (Optics Journal, New York, 2004).</ref> Dalitz co authored a succinct, and yet revealing, account of Ward's physics.<ref>R. H. Dalitz and F. J. Duarte, John Clive Ward, ''Physics Today'' '''53''' (10), 99-100 (2000).</ref>

==Publications==
During his lifetime, Dalitz produced numerous publications. One article lists 221 papers, and a total of 26 authored book reviews, public lectures and obituaries, and edited books.<ref name=AitchisonEtal2008/> Amongst his book reviews was a critical review of [[Andrew Pickering]]'s book ''Constructing Quarks'', in which he takes to task Pickering's implication that experimenters are essentially subservient to theoreticians, saying "In reality, experimenters are cussed individuals, eager to prove the theoreticians wrong whenever possible".<ref name=Dalitz1985/>

==Recognition==
Dalitz was made a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1960 and he received the [[Hughes Medal]] in 1975 "for his distinguished contributions to the theory of the basic particles of matter." He was also awarded the [[Maxwell Medal and Prize]] and the Royal Medal.
