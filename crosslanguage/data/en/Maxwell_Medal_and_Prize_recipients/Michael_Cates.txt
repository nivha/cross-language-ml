'''Michael Elmhirst Cates''', [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]], [[FRSE]] (born 5 May 1961) is a British [[physicist]]. He is Professor of Natural Philosophy and [[Royal Society]] Research Professor [http://royalsociety.org/grants/case-studies/michael-cates/] at the [[University of Edinburgh]].<ref>http://phyesta.supa.ac.uk/staff/prof-michael-cates</ref>

His scientific work is varied, but focuses on the theory of [[soft matter]], such as [[polymers]], [[colloids]], [[gels]], [[liquid crystals]], and [[granular material]]. A frequent goal is to create a [[mathematical model]] that predicts the [[stress (mechanics)|stress]] in a flowing material as a [[functional (mathematics)|functional]] of the flow history of that material. Such a mathematical model is called a [[constitutive equation]].

==Early life==
Cates was born on 5 May 1961.<ref name="Who's Who 2014">{{cite web|title=CATES, Prof. Michael Elmhirst|url=http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whoswho/U245746|work=Who's Who 2014|publisher=A & C Black|accessdate=5 May 2014}}</ref> He read Natural Sciences and earned a PhD at [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] in 1985, where he studied with Sir [[Sam Edwards (physicist)|Sam Edwards]].

==Academic career==
Cates was a Research Fellow and Lecturer at the [[Cavendish Laboratory]], University of Cambridge before moving to Edinburgh in 1995.

==Honours==
He won the 2013 Weissenberg Award of the European Society of [[Rheology]] <ref>http://rheology-esr.net/2013/04/04/weissenberg-award-to-michael-cates/ </ref> and was awarded the 2011 [[Pierre-Gilles de Gennes]] Lecture Prize<ref>http://lmc2011.univie.ac.at/de-gennes-lecture/</ref>
.
He won the 2009 Gold Medal of the British Society of [[Rheology]]. He was awarded the 2009 [[Dirac_Prize#Paul_Dirac_Medal_and_Prize|Dirac Prize]] by the Institute of Physics. He won the 1991 [[Maxwell Medal and Prize]]. 
He is currently an elected member of the Council of the [[Royal Society]], and has been an Honorary Fellow of [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] since 2013.<ref>http://phyesta.supa.ac.uk/staff/prof-michael-cates</ref>
