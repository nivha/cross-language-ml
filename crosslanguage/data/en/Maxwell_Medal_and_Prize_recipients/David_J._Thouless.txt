'''David James Thouless''' (born 21 September 1934) is a condensed-matter [[physicist]] and [[Wolf Prize]] winner.<ref>[http://books.google.ca/books?id=Z4PN4GnsrSgC&q=%22Thouless,+david+james%22+1934&dq=%22Thouless,+david+james%22+1934&hl=en&sa=X&ei=k9WWUdjJM-X5iwKd-oGQAw&ved=0CFQQ6AEwCA The international who's who 1991-92]</ref>

Thouless earned his PhD at [[Cornell University]] under [[Hans Bethe]]. He was a professor of mathematical physics at [[Birmingham University]] in the [[United Kingdom]] before becoming a professor of physics at the [[University of Washington]] in [[Seattle]] in 1980.  Thouless has made many theoretical contributions to the understanding of extended systems of atoms and electrons, and of nucleons.  Areas that his work has impacted include superconductivity phenomena, properties of nuclear matter, and excited collective motions within nuclei.

Thouless is a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]], Fellow of the [[American Physical Society]], Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], and a member of the U.S. [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]]. Among his many awards are the [[Wolf Prize]] for Physics (1990), the [[Dirac Prize|Paul Dirac Medal]] of the [[Institute of Physics]] (1993), and the Lars Onsager Prize of the [[American Physical Society]] (2000).
