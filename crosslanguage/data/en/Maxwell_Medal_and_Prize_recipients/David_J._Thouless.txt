David James Thouless (born 21 September 1934) is a condensed-matter physicist and Wolf Prize winner.

Thouless earned his PhD at Cornell University under Hans Bethe. He was a professor of mathematical physics at Birmingham University in the United Kingdom before becoming a professor of physics at the University of Washington in Seattle in 1980.  Thouless has made many theoretical contributions to the understanding of extended systems of atoms and electrons, and of nucleons.  Areas that his work has impacted include superconductivity phenomena, properties of nuclear matter, and excited collective motions within nuclei.

Thouless is a Fellow of the Royal Society, Fellow of the American Physical Society, Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and a member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences. Among his many awards are the Wolf Prize for Physics (1990), the Paul Dirac Medal of the Institute of Physics (1993), and the Lars Onsager Prize of the American Physical Society (2000).
