Sir Michael Victor Berry, FRS (born 14 March 1941), is a mathematical physicist at the University of Bristol, England.

He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of London in 1982 and knighted in 1996.  From 2006 he has been editor of the journal, Proceedings of the Royal Society.

He is famous for the Berry phase, a phenomenon observed e.g. in quantum mechanics and optics.  He specialises in semiclassical physics (asymptotic physics, quantum chaos), applied to wave phenomena in quantum mechanics and other areas such as optics. He is also currently affiliated with the Institute for Quantum Studies at Chapman University in California.
==Career==
The son of a London taxi driver, Berry has a BSc in physics from the University of Exeter and a PhD from the University of St. Andrews. Since then, he has spent his whole career at the University of Bristol: research fellow, 1965&ndash;67; lecturer, 1967&ndash;74; reader, 1974&ndash;78; Professor of Physics, 1978&ndash;88; Royal Society Research Professor since 1988.
