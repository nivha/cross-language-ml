Hawking is an [[Honorary Fellow]] of the [[Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures & Commerce|Royal Society of Arts]], a lifetime member of the [[Pontifical Academy of Sciences]], and a recipient of the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]], the highest civilian award in the United States. Hawking was the [[Lucasian Professor of Mathematics]] at the University of Cambridge between 1979 and 2009.

Hawking has achieved success with works of [[popular science]] in which he discusses his own theories and cosmology in general; his ''[[A Brief History of Time]]'' stayed on the British ''[[The Sunday Times|Sunday Times]]'' best-sellers list for a record-breaking 237 weeks. Hawking has a [[motor neuron disease]] related to [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS), a condition that has progressed over the years. He is almost entirely paralysed and communicates through a [[speech generating device]]. He married twice and has three children.

== Early life and education ==
Stephen Hawking was born on 8&nbsp;January 1942<ref name="whoswho">{{cite web |url=http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whoswho/U19510 |title=HAWKING, Prof. Stephen William |work=Who's Who 2014, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 2014; online edn, Oxford University Press }}{{subscription required}}</ref> to Frank and Isobel Hawking.{{sfn|Larsen|2005|pp=xiii, 2}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=21}} Despite their families' financial constraints, both parents attended the [[University of Oxford]], where Frank studied [[medicine]] and Isobel, [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics]].{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=21}} The two met shortly after the beginning of the [[World War II|Second World War]] at a medical research institute where she was working as a secretary and he as a [[medical research]]er.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=21}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=6}} They lived in [[Highgate]], but as London was [[the Blitz|under attack]] in those years, his mother went to [[Oxford]] to give birth in greater safety.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=21–22}}  Stephen has two younger sisters, Philippa and Mary, and an adopted brother, Edward.{{sfn|Larsen|2005|pp=2, 5}} He began his schooling at the Byron House School; he later blamed its "progressive methods" for his failure to learn to read while at the school.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=22}}

In 1950, when his father became head of the division of [[parasitology]] at the [[National Institute for Medical Research]], Hawking and his family moved to [[St Albans]], Hertfordshire.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=22}}{{sfn|Larsen|2005|p=xiii}}  The eight-year-old Hawking attended [[St Albans High School for Girls]] for a few months; at that time, younger boys could attend one of the houses.{{sfn|Larsen|2005|p=3}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=24}} In St Albans, the family were considered highly intelligent and somewhat eccentric;{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=22}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=12}} meals were often spent with each person silently reading a book.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=22}} They lived a frugal existence in a large, cluttered, and poorly maintained house, and travelled in a converted London taxicab.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=22–23}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=11–12}}  During one of Hawking's father's frequent absences working in Africa,{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=13}} the rest of the family spent four months in [[Majorca]] visiting his mother's friend Beryl and her husband, the poet [[Robert Graves]].{{sfn|Larsen|2005|p=3}} 

On their return to England, Hawking attended Radlett School for a year{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=24}} and from September 1952, [[St Albans School (Hertfordshire)|St Albans School]].{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=8}}  The family placed a high value on education.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=22}}  Hawking's father wanted his son to attend the well-regarded [[Westminster School]], but the 13-year-old Hawking was ill on the day of the scholarship examination.  His family could not afford the school fees without the financial aid of a scholarship, so Hawking remained at St Albans.{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=7–8}}{{sfn|Larsen|2005|p=4}} A positive consequence was that Hawking remained with a close group of friends with whom he enjoyed board games, the manufacture of fireworks, model aeroplanes and boats,{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=25–26}} and long discussions about [[Christianity]] and [[extrasensory perception]].{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=14–16}} From 1958, and with the help of the mathematics teacher [[Dikran Tahta]], they built a computer from clock parts, an old telephone switchboard and other recycled components.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=26}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=19–20}}  Although at school he was known as "Einstein," Hawking was not initially successful academically.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=25}}  With time, he began to show considerable aptitude for scientific subjects, and inspired by Tahta, decided to study mathematics at university.{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=17–18}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=27}}<ref>{{cite news

}}</ref> Hawking's father advised him to study medicine, concerned that there were few jobs for mathematics graduates.{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=41}} He wanted Hawking to attend [[University College, Oxford]], his own [[alma mater]]. As it was not possible to read mathematics there at the time, Hawking decided to study physics and chemistry. Despite his headmaster's advice to wait until the next year, Hawking was awarded a scholarship after taking the examinations in March 1959.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=27–28}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=42–43}}

=== University ===
Hawking began his university education at the [[University of Oxford]] in October 1959 at the age of 17.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=28}} For the first 18 months, he was bored and lonely: he was younger than many other students, and found the academic work "ridiculously easy."{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=28–29}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=46–47, 51}}  His physics tutor Robert Berman later said, "It was only necessary for him to know that something could be done, and he could do it without looking to see how other people did it."{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=29}} A change occurred during his second and third year when, according to Berman, Hawking made more effort "to be one of the boys". He developed into a popular, lively and witty college member, interested in classical music and science fiction.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=28}} Part of the transformation resulted from his decision to join the college Boat Club, where he [[Coxswain (rowing)|coxed]] a rowing team.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=30–31}}{{sfn|Hawking|1992|loc=p. 44}} The rowing trainer at the time noted that Hawking cultivated a daredevil image, steering his crew on risky courses that led to damaged boats.{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=50}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=30–31}}  Hawking has estimated that he studied about 1,000 hours during his three years at Oxford. These unimpressive study habits made sitting his Finals a challenge, and he decided to answer only [[theoretical physics]] questions rather than those requiring factual knowledge. A [[British undergraduate degree classification|first-class honours degree]] was a condition of acceptance for his planned graduate study in [[cosmology]] at the University of Cambridge.{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=53}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=31}}  Anxious, he slept poorly the night before the examinations and the final result was on the borderline between first- and second-class honours, making a ''[[oral exam|viva]]'' necessary.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=31}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=54}}  Hawking was concerned that he was viewed as a lazy and difficult student, so when asked at the oral examination to describe his future plans, he said, "If you award me a First, I will go to Cambridge. If I receive a Second, I shall stay in Oxford, so I expect you will give me a First."{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=31}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=54–55}} He was held in higher regard than he believed: as Berman commented, the examiners "were intelligent enough to realise they were talking to someone far cleverer than most of themselves."{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=31}} After receiving a [[First Class Honours#First-class honours|first-class]] [[Honours degree|BA (Hons.) degree]], and following a trip to [[Iran]] with a friend, he began his graduate work at [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge]], in October 1962.{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=56}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=31–32}}

Hawking's first year as a [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctoral student]]<ref name="hawkingphd"/> was difficult.  He was initially disappointed to find that he had been assigned [[Dennis William Sciama]] as a supervisor rather than [[Fred Hoyle]],{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=33}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=58}} and he found his training in mathematics inadequate for work in [[general relativity]] and [[cosmology]].{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=33–34}} He also struggled with his health. Hawking had experienced increasing clumsiness during his final year at Oxford, including a fall on some stairs and difficulties when rowing.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=32}}<ref>{{cite news | last = Donaldson | first = Gregg J.  | title = The Man Behind the Scientist |url=http://www.mdtap.org/TT/1999.05/1-art.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050511104943/http://www.mdtap.org/TT/1999.05/1-art.html | archivedate = 11 May 2005 | publisher = Tapping Technology | date = May 1999  | accessdate = 23 December 2012 }}</ref>  The problems worsened, and his speech became slightly [[dysarthria|slurred]]; his family noticed the changes when he returned home for Christmas and medical investigations were begun.{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=59}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=34–35}} The diagnosis of [[motor neurone disease]] came when Hawking was 21. At the time, doctors gave him a life expectancy of two years.{{sfn|Larsen|2005|pp=18–19}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=59–61}} After his diagnosis, Hawking fell into a depression; though his doctors advised that he continue with his studies, he felt there was little point.{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=61–63}} At the same time, however, his relationship with Jane Wilde, friend of his sister, and whom he had met shortly before his diagnosis, continued to develop. The couple were engaged in October 1964.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=37–40}}{{sfn|Larsen|2005|p=xiv}} Hawking later said that the engagement "gave him something to live for."{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=40}}
Despite the disease's progression—Hawking had difficulty walking without support, and his speech was almost unintelligible—he now returned to his work with enthusiasm.{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=69–70}} Hawking started developing a reputation for brilliance and brashness when he publicly challenged the work of Fred Hoyle and his student [[Jayant Narlikar]] at a lecture in June 1964.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=42}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=68–69}}

When Hawking began his graduate studies, there was much debate in the physics community about the prevailing theories of the creation of the universe: the [[Big Bang]] and the [[Steady State theory|Steady State]] theories.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=34}} Inspired by [[Roger Penrose]]'s theorem of a spacetime singularity in the centre of black holes, Hawking applied the same thinking to the entire universe, and during 1965 wrote up his thesis on this topic.{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=71–72}}   There were other positive developments: Hawking received a research fellowship at [[Gonville and Caius College]], and he and Jane were married on 14 July 1965.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=43–44}} He obtained his [[Doctor of Philosophy|D.Phil.]] degree in March 1966,{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=47}} and his essay entitled "Singularities and the Geometry of Space-Time" shared top honours with one by Penrose to win that year's [[Adams Prize]].{{sfn|Larsen|2005|p=xix}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=47}}

== Later life and career ==

=== 1966–1975 ===
The first years of marriage were hectic: Jane lived in London during the week as she completed her degree and they travelled to the United States several times for conferences and physics-related visits. The couple had difficulty finding housing that was within Hawking's walking distance to the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics (DAMTP). Jane began a Ph.D. program, and a son, Robert, was born in May 1967.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=45–47}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=92–98}}  In his work, and in collaboration with Penrose, Hawking extended the singularity theorem concepts first explored in his doctoral thesis. This included not only the existence of singularities but also the theory that the universe might have started as a singularity. Their joint essay was the runner-up in the 1968 [[Gravity Research Foundation]] competition.{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=101}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=61,64}} In 1970 they published a proof that if the universe obeys [[general relativity|the general theory of relativity]] and fits any of the [[Friedmann equations|models]] of [[physical cosmology]] developed by [[Alexander Friedmann]], then it must have [[Penrose–Hawking singularity theorems|begun as a singularity]].{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=64–65}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=115–16}}<ref>{{cite journal

During the late 1960s, Hawking's physical abilities declined once more: he began to use crutches and ceased lecturing regularly.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=48–49}} As he slowly lost the ability to write, he developed compensatory visual methods, including seeing equations in terms of geometry.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=76–77}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=124–25}}  The physicist [[Werner Israel]] later compared the achievements to Mozart composing an entire symphony in his head.<ref>{{cite web

He preferred to be regarded as "a scientist first, popular science writer second, and, in all the ways that matter, a normal human being with the same desires, drives, dreams, and ambitions as the next person."{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=viii}}  Jane Hawking later noted that "Some people would call it determination, some obstinacy. I've called it both at one time or another."{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=48}} He required much persuasion to accept the use of a wheelchair at the end of the 1960s,{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=117}} but ultimately became notorious for the wildness of his wheelchair driving.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=48}} Hawking was a popular and witty colleague, but his illness as well as his reputation for brashness and intelligence distanced him from some.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=162}} In 1969, Hawking accepted a specially created 'Fellowship for Distinction in Science' to remain at Caius.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=49}}

A daughter, [[Lucy Hawking|Lucy]], was born in 1970.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=65}}  Soon after Hawking discovered what became known as [[Second law of black hole mechanics|the second law of black hole dynamics]], that the event horizon of a black hole can never get smaller.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=65–67}}  With [[James M. Bardeen]] and [[Brandon Carter]], he proposed the four [[laws of black hole mechanics]], drawing an analogy with [[thermodynamics]].{{sfn|Larsen|2005|p=38}} To Hawking's irritation, [[Jacob Bekenstein]], a graduate student of [[John Archibald Wheeler|John Wheeler]], went further—and ultimately correctly—applying thermodynamic concepts literally.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=67–68}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=123–24}}  In the early 1970s, Hawking's work with Carter, Werner Israel and David C. Robinson strongly supported Wheeler's [[no-hair theorem]] that no matter what the original material from which a black hole is created it can be completely described by the properties of [[mass]], [[electrical charge]] and rotation.{{sfn|Larsen|2005|p=33}}<ref name="HawkingIsrael1989">{{cite book|editors=S.

Beginning in 1973, Hawking moved into the study of [[quantum gravity]] and [[quantum mechanics]].{{sfn|Larsen|2005|p=39}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=68}}  His work in this area was spurred by a visit to [[Moscow]] and discussions with [[Yakov Borisovich Zel'dovich]] and Alexei Starobinsky, whose work showed that according to the [[uncertainty principle]] rotating black holes emit particles.{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=146}} To Hawking's annoyance, his much-checked calculations produced findings that contradicted his second law, which claimed black holes could never get smaller,{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=70}} and supported Bekenstein's reasoning about their [[Black hole entropy|entropy]].{{sfn|Larsen|2005|p=41}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=146}} His results, which Hawking presented from 1974, showed that black holes emit [[radiation]], known today as [[Hawking radiation]], which may continue until they exhaust their energy and [[Black hole#Evaporation|evaporate]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hawking |first=Stephen W. |year=1974 |title=Black hole explosions? |journal=Nature |volume=248 |issue=5443 |pages=30–31 |doi=10.1038/248030a0 |bibcode = 1974Natur.248...30H }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Hawking |first=Stephen W.  |year=1975 |title=Particle creation by black holes |journal=[[Communications in Mathematical Physics]] |volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=199–220 |doi=10.1007/BF02345020|bibcode = 1975CMaPh..43..199H }}</ref>{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=69–73}}  Initially, Hawking radiation was controversial. However by the late 1970s and following the publication of further research, the discovery was widely accepted as a significant breakthrough in theoretical physics.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=70–74}}{{sfn|Larsen|2005|pp=42–43}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=150–51}}
In March 1974, a few weeks after the announcement of Hawking radiation, Hawking was invested as a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]], one of the youngest scientists to be so honoured.{{sfn|Larsen|2005|p=44}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=133}}

Hawking rarely discussed his illness and physical challenges, even—in a precedent set during their courtship—with Jane.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=37–39, 77}} Hawking's disabilities meant that the responsibilities of home and family rested firmly on his wife's increasingly overwhelmed shoulders, leaving him more time to think about physics.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=78}}  When in 1974 Hawking was appointed to the Sherman Fairchild Distinguished Scholar visiting professorship at the [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech), Jane proposed that a graduate or post-doctoral student live with them and help with his care. Hawking accepted, and [[Bernard Carr]] travelled to California with them as the first of many students who fulfilled this role.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=82–83}}<ref name=black>{{cite book|author=Stephen Hawking|title=Black Holes and Baby Universes and Other Essays|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=NU9SoEwgdskC&pg=PT20|year=1994|publisher=Random House |isbn=978-0-553-37411-7|page=20}}</ref>  The family spent a generally happy and stimulating year in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]].{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=83–88}}  Hawking worked with his friend on the faculty, [[Kip Thorne]],{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=82, 86}} and engaged him in a [[scientific wager]] about whether the [[dark star (dark matter)|dark star]] [[Cygnus X-1]] was a black hole. The wager was a surprising "insurance policy" against the proposition that black holes did not exist.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=86–88}} Hawking acknowledged that he had lost the bet in 1990, which was the first of several that he was to make with Thorne and others.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=150,189, 219}}  Hawking has maintained ties to Caltech, spending a month there almost every year since this first visit.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=95}}

=== 1975–1990 ===

Hawking returned to Cambridge in 1975 to a new home, a new job—as [[Reader (academic rank)|Reader]].  [[Don Page (physicist)|Don Page]], with whom Hawking had begun a close friendship at Caltech, arrived to work as the live-in graduate student assistant.  With Page's help and that of a secretary, Jane's responsibilities were reduced so she could return to her thesis and her new interest in singing.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=89–90}}
The mid to late 1970s were a period of growing public interest in black holes and of the physicist who was studying them. Hawking was regularly interviewed for print and television.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=90}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=132–33}}  He also received increasing academic recognition of his work.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=92}}   In 1975 he was awarded both the [[Eddington Medal]] and the [[Pontifical Academy of Sciences|Pius XI Gold Medal]], and in 1976 the [[Dannie Heineman Prize]], the [[Maxwell Prize]] and the [[Hughes Medal]].{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=162}}{{sfn|Larsen|2005|pp=xv}} Hawking was appointed a [[professor]] with a chair in [[gravitational physics]] in 1977.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=91}} The following year he received the [[Albert Einstein Medal]] and an honorary doctorate from the University of Oxford.{{sfn|Larsen|2005|pp=xiv}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=92}}

Hawking's speech deteriorated, and by the late 1970s he could only be understood by his family and closest friends. To communicate with others, someone who knew him well would translate his speech into intelligible speech.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=81–82}}  Spurred by a dispute with the university over who would pay for the ramp needed for him to enter his workplace, Hawking and his wife campaigned for improved access and support for those with disabilities in Cambridge,{{sfn|Mialet|2003|pp=450–51}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=79, 149}} including adapted student housing at the university.{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=273–74}} In general, however, Hawking had ambivalent feelings about his role as a disability rights champion: while wanting to help others, he sought to detach himself from his illness and its challenges.{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=193–94}} His lack of engagement led to some criticism.{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=194}}  The Hawking family welcomed a third child, Timothy, in April 1979.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=92}} That autumn Hawking was appointed the [[Lucasian Professor of Mathematics]] at the University of Cambridge.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=92}}<ref>{{cite news

Hawking's inaugural lecture as Lucasian Professor of Mathematics was titled: "Is the end in sight for Theoretical Physics" and proposed  [[N=8 Supergravity]] as the leading theory to solve many of the outstanding problems physicists were studying.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=93–94}} Hawking's promotion coincided with a health crisis which led to Hawking accepting, albeit reluctantly, some nursing services at home.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=92–93}} At the same time he was also making a transition in his approach to physics, becoming more intuitive and speculative rather than insisting on mathematical proofs. "I would rather be right than rigorous" he told Kip Thorne.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=96}} In 1981 he proposed that information in a black hole is irretrievably lost when a black hole evaporates.  This [[Black hole information paradox|information paradox]] violates the fundamental tenet of quantum mechanics, and was to lead to years of debate, including "[[the Black Hole War]]" with [[Leonard Susskind]] and [[Gerard 't Hooft]].{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=96–101}}<ref name="Susskind2008">{{cite book|author=Leonard Susskind|title=The Black Hole War: My Battle with Stephen Hawking to Make the World Safe for Quantum Mechanics|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=f3_rnRVxGIsC&pg=PT9|date=7 July 2008|publisher=Hachette Digital, Inc.|isbn=978-0-316-01640-7|pages=9, 18}}</ref>

In December 1977, Jane had met organist Jonathan Hellyer Jones when singing in a church choir. Hellyer Jones became close to the Hawking family, and by the mid-1980s, he and Jane had developed romantic feelings for each other.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=91}}{{sfn|Larsen|2005|pp=xiv, 79}}{{sfn|Hawking|2007|pp=279–80}} According to Jane, her husband was accepting of the situation, stating "he would not object so long as I continued to love him."{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=91}}{{sfn|Larsen|2005|p=79}}{{sfn|Hawking|2007|p=285}} Jane and Hellyer Jones determined not to break up the family and their relationship remained platonic for a long period.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=91–92}}

[[Inflation (cosmology)|Cosmological inflation]]—a theory proposing that following the Big Bang the universe initially expanded incredibly rapidly before settling down to a slower expansion—was proposed by [[Alan Guth]] and also developed by [[Andrei Linde]].{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=108–11}} Following a conference in Moscow in October 1981, Hawking and [[Gary Gibbons]] organized a three-week Nuffield Workshop in the summer of 1982 on the Very Early Universe at Cambridge University, which focused mainly on inflation theory.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=111–14}}<ref>See Guth (1997) for a popular description of the workshop, or ''The Very Early Universe'', ISBN 0-521-31677-4 eds Gibbons, Hawking & Siklos for a detailed report.</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=The development of irregularities in a single bubble inflationary universe|first=S.W.|last=Hawking|journal=Phys.Lett.|volume=B115|page=295|year=1982|bibcode=1982PhLB..115..295H|doi=10.1016/0370-2693(82)90373-2|issue=4}}</ref> Hawking also began a new line of quantum theory research into the origin of the universe. In 1981 at a Vatican conference he presented work suggesting that there might be no boundary—or beginning or ending—to the universe.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=102–13}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=180}} He subsequently developed the research in collaboration with [[James Hartle|Jim Hartle]], and in 1983 they published a model, known as the [[Hartle–Hawking state]].  It proposed that prior to the [[Planck epoch]], the [[universe]] had no boundary in space-time; before the Big Bang, time did not exist and the concept of the beginning of the universe is meaningless.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1103/PhysRevD.28.2960}}</ref> The initial singularity of the classical Big Bang models was replaced with a region akin to the North Pole. One cannot travel north of the North Pole, but there is no boundary there—it is simply the point where all north-running lines meet and end.{{sfn|Baird|2007|loc=p. 234}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=180–83}} Initially the no-boundary proposal predicted a [[Shape of the Universe|closed universe]] which had implications about the existence of God. As Hawking explained "If the universe has no boundaries but is self-contained... then God would not have had any freedom to choose how the universe began."{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=129}}

Hawking did not rule out the existence of a Creator, asking in ''A Brief History of Time'' "Is the unified theory so compelling that it brings about its own existence?"{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=130}} In his early work, Hawking spoke of God in a metaphorical sense. In ''A Brief History of Time'' he wrote: "If we discover a complete theory, it would be the ultimate triumph of human reason—for then we should know the mind of God."<ref name="sample">{{cite news

In the same book he suggested the existence of God was unnecessary to explain the origin of the universe.  Later discussions with [[Neil Turok]] led to the realisation that it is also compatible with an open universe.{{sfn|Yulsman|2003|loc=pp.&nbsp;174–176}}

Further work by Hawking in the area of [[Arrow of time|arrows of time]] led to the 1985 publication of a paper theorising that if the no-boundary proposition were correct, then when the universe stopped expanding and eventually collapsed, time would run backwards.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=180–182}} A paper by Don Page and [[Raymond Laflamme]] led Hawking to withdraw this concept.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=182}}
Honours continued to be awarded: in 1981 he was awarded the American [[Franklin Medal]],{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=274}} and in 1982 made a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE).{{sfn|Larsen|2005|pp=x–xix}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=114}} Awards do not pay the bills, however, and motivated by the need to finance the children's education and home expenses, in 1982 Hawking determined to write a popular book about the universe that would be accessible to the general public.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=134–35}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=205, 220–21}} Instead of publishing with an academic press, he signed a contract with [[Bantam Books]], a mass market publisher, and received a large advance for his book.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=134}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=220–27}}  A first draft of the book, called ''[[A Brief History of Time]]'', was completed in 1984.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=135}}

During a visit to CERN in Geneva in the summer of 1985, Hawking contracted [[pneumonia]] which in his condition was life-threatening; he was so ill that Jane was asked if life support should be terminated. She refused but the consequence was a [[tracheotomy]], which would require round-the-clock nursing care, and remove what remained of his speech.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=132–36}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=232–36}}  The [[National Health Service]] would pay for a [[nursing home]] but Jane was determined that he would live at home.  The cost of the care was funded by an American foundation.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=136–37}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=235–36}} Nurses were hired for the three shifts required to provide the round-the-clock support he required. One of those employed was Elaine Mason, who was to become Hawking's second wife.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=139}} For his communication, Hawking initially raised his eyebrows to choose [[Partner-assisted scanning|letters on a spelling card]].{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=136}} But he then received a computer program called the "Equalizer" from Walt Woltosz. In a method he uses to this day, using a switch he selects phrases, words or letters from a bank of about 2500–3000 that are [[Switch access scanning|scanned]].{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=137–38}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=236–37}} The program was originally run on a desktop computer. However, Elaine Mason's husband David, a computer engineer, adapted a small computer and attached it to his wheelchair.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=140}} Released from the need to use somebody to interpret his speech, Hawking commented that "I can communicate better now than before I lost my voice."{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=140–41}} The voice he uses has an American accent and is no longer produced.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=138}}<ref>{{cite web

=== 1990–2000 ===
Hawking's marriage had been strained for many years. Jane felt overwhelmed by the intrusion into their family life of the required nurses and assistants. The impact of his celebrity was challenging for colleagues and family members, and in one interview Jane described her role as "simply to tell him that he's not God."{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=164–65}}<ref name="dt70" /> Hawking's agnostic views of religion also contrasted with her strong Christian faith, and resulted in tension.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=80–81}}<ref name="dt70">{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/stephen-hawking/8989060/Stephen-Hawking-driven-by-a-cosmic-force-of-will.html |title=Stephen Hawking: driven by a cosmic force of will |first= Roger|last=Highfield |work=The Daily Telegraph |date= 3 January 2012  |location=London|accessdate=7 December 2012}}</ref><ref name=obs2004>{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/theobserver/2004/apr/04/features.review17 |title= Brief History of a first wife |first=Tim |last=Adams |work=[[The Observer]] |date=4 April 2004 |location=London |accessdate=12 February 2013}}</ref> In the late 1980s Hawking had grown close to one of his nurses, Elaine Mason, to the dismay of some colleagues, caregivers and family members who were disturbed by her strength of personality and protectiveness.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=145}} Hawking told Jane that he was leaving her for Mason,{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=165}} and departed the family home in February 1990.{{sfn|Larsen|2005|pp=x–xix}}  Following his divorce from Jane in the spring of 1995, Hawking married Mason in September,{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=186–87}}{{sfn|Larsen|2005|pp=x–xix}} declaring "It's wonderful—I have married the woman I love."{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=187}}

Hawking pursued his work in physics: in 1993 he co-edited a book on [[Euclidean quantum gravity]] with Gary Gibbons, and published a collected edition of his own articles on black holes and the Big Bang.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=180}} In 1994 at Cambridge's [[Newton Institute]], Hawking and Penrose delivered a series of six lectures, which were published in 1996 as "The Nature of Space and Time".{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=188}}  In 1997 he conceded a 1991 public [[scientific wager]] made with Kip Thorne and [[John Preskill]] of Caltech. Hawking had bet that Penrose's proposal of a "cosmic censorship conjecture"—that there could be no "naked singularities" unclothed within a horizon—was correct.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=189–90}} After discovering his concession might have been premature, a new, more refined, wager was made. This specified that such singularities would occur without extra conditions.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=190}} The same year, Thorne, Hawking and Preskill made another bet, this time concerning the [[black hole information paradox]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theory.caltech.edu/%7Epreskill/info_bet.html |title=Black hole information bet|last1 = Hawking | first1 = S.W.|last2 = Thorne | first2 = K.S.|last3 = Preskill|location=Pasadena, California |date=6 February 1997 |accessdate=20 April 2013}}</ref><ref name="concedbet">{{cite journal

Since this contradicted the [[quantum mechanics]] of microcausality, quantum mechanics theory would need to be rewritten.

Hawking also maintained his public profile, including bringing science to a wider audience.  In 1992 a film version of "A Brief History of Time"—directed by [[Errol Morris]] and produced by [[Steven Spielberg]]—was premiered. Hawking had wanted the film to be scientific rather than biographical, but was persuaded otherwise. The film, while a critical success, was however not widely released.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=168–70}} A popular-level collection of essays, interviews and talk titled ''[[Black Holes and Baby Universes and Other Essays]]'' was published in 1993{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=178}} and six-part television series [[Stephen Hawking's Universe]] and companion book appeared in 1997. As Hawking insisted, this time the focus was entirely on science.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=189}}{{sfn|Larsen|2005|p=97}} He also made several appearances in popular media.  At the release party for the home video version of the "A Brief History of Time", [[Leonard Nimoy]], who had played [[Spock]] on ''[[Star Trek]]'', learnt that Hawking was interested in appearing on the show. Nimoy made the necessary contact and Hawking appeared as himself on ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' in 1993.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=177–78}}{{sfn|Larsen|2005|pp=93–94}}{{sfn|Okuda|Okuda|1999|p=380}} The same year, his synthesiser voice was recorded for the [[Pink Floyd]] song "[[Keep Talking]]",{{sfn|Larsen|2005|pp=xiii, 94}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=178}} and in 1999 for an appearance on [[The Simpsons]].{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=192}}

In the 1990s, Hawking accepted more openly the mantle of role model for disabled people, including lecturing on the subject and participating in fundraising activities.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=164, 178}} At the turn of the century, he and eleven other luminaries signed the ''"Charter for the Third Millennium on Disability"'' which called on governments to prevent disability and protect disabled rights.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/441912.stm |title=Call for global disability campaign |publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] |date=8 September 1999 |location=London |accessdate=12 February 2013}}</ref>{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=196}}  In 1999 Hawking was awarded the [[Lilienfeld Prize|Julius Edgar Lilienfeld Prize]] of the [[American Physical Society]].<ref>{{cite web

==Awards and honours==
Hawking has received numerous awards and honours. In 1974 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]] (FRS). His nomination reads{{centered pull quote|Hawking has made major contributions to the field of general relativity. These derive from a deep understanding of what is relevant to physics and astronomy, and especially from a mastery of wholly new mathematical techniques. Following the pioneering work of Penrose he established, partly alone and partly in collaboration with Penrose, a series of successively stronger theorems establishing the fundamental result that all realistic cosmological models must possess singularities. Using similar techniques, Hawking has proved the basic theorems on the laws governing black holes: that stationary solutions of Einstein's equations with smooth event horizons must necessarily be axisymmetric; and that in the evolution and interaction of black holes, the total surface area of the event horizons must increase. In collaboration with G. Ellis, Hawking is the author of an impressive and original treatise on "Space-time in the Large".
Other important work by Hawking relates to the interpretation of cosmological observations and to the design of gravitational wave detectors.<ref name="royal">{{cite web |url=http://royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqDb=Catalog&dsqCmd=show.tcl&dsqSearch=(RefNo==%27EC%2F1974%2F12%27) |title = Library and Archive Catalogue: Hawking, Stephen, EC/1974/12 |publisher=The Royal Society |archivedate=2014-02-04 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6N82r0VCh |location=London}}</ref>}}
