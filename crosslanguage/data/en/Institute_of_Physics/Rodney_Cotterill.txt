}}</ref>) was an [[England|English]]-[[Denmark|Danish]] [[physics|physicist]], and [[neuroscience|neuroscientist]], who was educated at [[University College London]] (B.Sc., 1st), [[Yale]] (M.S.) and [[Cambridge University]] (Ph.D.). He spent most of his career as a [[professor]] at the [[Technical University of Denmark]], Denmark, (1967-) after having spent five years as a researcher at the [[Argonne National Laboratory]].

==Scientific career==
Cotterill was a prolific scientist who published over two hundred highly cited papers and books on a variety of topics in physics, biology and medicine. His initial research was in [[materials science]], which was of such a high standard that he was subsequently elected to the [[Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters]]. He became gradually more interested in [[biophysics]], and especially the [[human brain]], where he subsequently made important contributions to the study of [[consciousness]].

He was awarded Knight, first class of the Dannebrog in 1994 and given an honorary D.Sc. in 1973 by London University in [[materials science]]. Cotterill was a Fellow of the [[Institute of Physics]] (U.K.) (1967), Fellow, Danish Academy of Technical Science (1974-, Presidium, 1985-7) and a Fellow of the [[Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters]] (1984-, Presidium 1990-6). He was awarded the Hans and Ellen Hermer Memorial Prize in 1978 for his pioneering work in computer simulation.

His lectures at the Technical University of Denmark in Biophysics and Brain-Physics were popular among students. In 2001 he received the "Lecturer of the Year" award, nominated by students.[http://www.polytechphotos.dk/index.php?CHGLAN=2&CatID=1863&PicID=1543]

==Life and other writings==
Cotterill wrote widely for the general public and his first book ''The Cambridge Guide to the Material World'' was published to great critical acclaim. 

Rodney Cotterill was born in [[Cornwall]], near [[Jamaica Inn]], Bolventor. In 1959, he married the Dane Vibeke Ejler Nielsen with whom he had two children Marianne and Jennifer, of which the former is a soprano singer and the latter has autism.
