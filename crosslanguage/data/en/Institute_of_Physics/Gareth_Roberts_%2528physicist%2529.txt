== Commissioned reviews ==

=== SET for Success ===

In March 2001, the UK Government commissioned Roberts to undertake a review into the supply of science and engineering skills in the UK. The final report, entitled '''SET for Success''' was published on 15 April 2003.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/documents/enterprise_and_productivity/research_and_enterprise/ent_res_roberts.cfm | title = SET for Success | work = [[HM Treasury]] |date=April 2005 | accessdate = 2007-02-11 }}</ref> The report set out thirty-seven recommendations to the Government, employers and other organisations about how to maintain and develop the supply of people with science, technology, engineering and mathematical skills into research and industry. All his recommendations were accepted by the Government. These included providing additional resources for schools, universities and research bodies, and the promotion of school/business links.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.foundation.org.uk/events/pdf/20021022_Summary.pdf | title = Dinner Discussion Summary, Sir Gareth Roberts’ Review, Held Tuesday 22nd October 2002 | format = pdf | work = [[Foundation for Science and Technology]] |date=October 2002 | accessdate = 2007-02-11 }}</ref> The review led to increase of the [[stipend]] paid to PhD students, and a number of initiatives to encourage women and young people to consider a career in science.<ref>{{cite web | url =

===The review of research assessment===
In June 2002, after the [[Research Assessment Exercise]] (RAE) of 2001, the four funding bodies for UK higher education commissioned Sir Gareth Roberts to review the future of research assessment in the UK.  The report ''"The review of research assessment"'' was issued for consultation in May 2003.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.hefce.ac.uk/news/hefce/2003/rareview.htm | title = Funding bodies consult on the future of research assessment | work = [[Higher Education Funding Council for England]] | date = 2003-05-29 | accessdate = 2007-01-30 }}</ref> Many of Roberts' recommendations were implemented for the 2008 RAE, the first review following the completion of the consultation exercise.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.hefce.ac.uk/News/HEFCE/2004/rae.asp | title = Quality profile will provide fuller and fairer assessment of research | work = [[Higher Education Funding Council for England]] | date = 2004-02-11 | accessdate = 2007-02-11 }}</ref>
