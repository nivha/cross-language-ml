==Awards and honours==
Jackson was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]] in 1953, his nomination reads.{{centred pull quote|Jackson's work has been devoted, mainly, to correlating the electrical behaviour of dielectric materials with their chemical composition and physical structure through studies of the mechanisms of energy-loss and breakdown under alternating electric stress, and to developing new techniques of measurement for investigation of these properties at cm. And mm. wave-lengths. This work is directly related to his studies of the behaviour of transmission lines and wave-guides, and of their applications in radar and communication systems: here his investigations on polythene and barium titanate ceramics are of outstanding importance.<ref name="royal">{{cite web|url=http://royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqDb=Catalog&dsqCmd=show.tcl&dsqSearch=(RefNo==%27EC%2F1953%2F15%27)|publisher=The Royal Society|accessdate=2013-11-28|title=Jackson, Willis, Baron Jackson of Burnley|location=London}}</ref>}}

==Personal life==
In 1938 he married Mary, daughter of Robert Oliphant Boswall, a lecturer in [[mechanical engineering]]; they had two daughters.<ref name = "frs"/>{{rp|=382}}

One of Jackson's closest friends was the physicist [[John F. Allen (physicist)|John F. Allen]].<ref name = "frs"/>{{rp|379}} In his last years he supported the development of the [[Indian Institutes of Technology]].<ref name="frs"/>{{rp|392}}
