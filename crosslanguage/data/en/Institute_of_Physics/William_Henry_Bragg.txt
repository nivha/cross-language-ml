==Biography==
[[File:Market Harborough Grammar School.jpg|235px|right|thumb|The Old Grammar School, Market Harborough, which has a plaque inside noting Bragg's attendance]]
===Early years===
Bragg was born at [[Westward, Cumbria|Westward]] near [[Wigton]], [[Cumberland]], the son of Robert John Bragg, a merchant marine officer and farmer, and his wife Mary née Wood, a clergyman's daughter. When Bragg was seven years old, his mother died, and he was raised by his uncle, also named William Bragg, at [[Market Harborough]], [[Leicestershire]]. He was educated at the Old Grammar School there, at [[King William's College]] on the [[Isle of Man]] and, having won an [[exhibition (scholarship)]], at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]. He graduated in 1884 as third [[Wrangler (University of Cambridge)|wrangler]], and in 1885 was awarded a first class honours in the mathematical [[tripos]].<ref>{{acad|id=BRG880WH|name=Bragg, William Henry}}</ref><ref name=dab>{{Dictionary of Australian Biography | First=William Henry | Last=Bragg | Link=http://gutenberg.net.au/dictbiog/0-dict-biogBr-By.html#bragg1 | accessdate=7 October 2008 }}</ref><ref name=adb>{{Australian Dictionary of Biography | last=Tomlin | first=S. G. | year=1979 | id=A070396b | title= Bragg, Sir William Henry (1862–1942) | accessdate=7 October 2008 }}</ref>

===University of Adelaide===
In 1885, (at the age of 23), Bragg was appointed (Sir Thomas) [[Elder Professor of Mathematics]] and Experimental Physics in the [[University of Adelaide]],<ref>[http://www.physics.adelaide.edu.au/history/BraggCentenary.htm Bragg Centenary, 1886–1986], University of Adelaide, Pages 3 & 4. Proof of advertisement in the Oxford University Gazette of 16 October 1885, and the Cambridge University Reporter of 13 October 1885. The advertisements read:
:THE UNIVERSITY OF ADELAIDE
:ELDER PROFESSOR OF MATHEMATICS AND EXPERIMENTAL PHYSICS
:The Council invite applications for the above Professorship. Salary £800 per annum. The appointment will be for a term of five years, subject to renewal at the discretion of the Council. Salary will date from March&nbsp;1, 1886, and the Professor will be expected to enter on his duties on that date. An allowance will be made for travelling expenses. Applications with testimonials should reach ... not later than December&nbsp;1, 1885.
Bragg was informed of his appointment by a letter dated 17 December 1885.</ref> and started work there early in 1886. Being a skilled mathematician, at that time he had limited knowledge of physics, most of which was in the form of applied mathematics he had learnt at Trinity. Also at that time, there were only about a hundred students doing full courses at Adelaide, of whom less than a handful belonged to the science school, whose deficient teaching facilities Bragg improved by apprenticing himself to a firm of instrument makers. Bragg was an able and popular lecturer; he encouraged the formation of the student union, and the attendance, free of charge, of science teachers at his lectures.<ref name=dab/><ref name=adb/>

Bragg's interest in physics developed, particularly in the field of electromagnetism. <!-- In his early years, he spent a year at the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] taking the equivalent of an undergraduate course.{{cn|date=November 2010}} --> In 1895 he was visited by [[Ernest Rutherford]], en route from New Zealand to Cambridge; this was the commencement of a lifelong friendship. "The turning-point in Bragg's career came in 1904 when he gave the presidential address to section A of the [[Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science]] at [[Dunedin]], New Zealand",<ref name=adb/> on "Some Recent Advances in the Theory of the Ionization of Gases". This idea was followed up "in a brilliant series of researches"<ref name=adb/> which, within three years, earned him a fellowship of the [[Royal Society]] of London. This paper was also the origin of his first book ''Studies in Radioactivity'' (1912). Soon after the delivery of his 1904 address, some [[radium bromide]] was made available to Bragg for experimentation. In December 1904 his paper "On the Absorption of α Rays and on the Classification of the α Rays from Radium" appeared in the ''Philosophical Magazine'', and in the same issue a paper "On the Ionization Curves of Radium", written in collaboration with his student [[Richard Kleeman]], also appeared.<ref name=dab/><ref name=adb/>

At the end of 1908 Bragg returned to England. During his 23 years in Australia "he had seen the number of students at the University of Adelaide almost quadruple, and had a full share in the development of its excellent science school."<ref name=dab/>

Whilst in [[Adelaide]], Bragg played tennis and golf, and as a founding member of the [[North Adelaide]] and [[Adelaide University Lacrosse Club]]s, contributed to the introduction of [[lacrosse]] to South Australia and was also the secretary of the Adelaide University Chess Assosciation.<ref>[http://www.physics.adelaide.edu.au/history/BraggCentenary.htm Bragg Centenary, 1886–1986], University of Adelaide, page 43.</ref> He also met Gwendoline née Todd, a skilled water-colour painter, whom he married in 1889.<ref name=dab/><ref name=adb/> Their first son, William Lawrence, was born in North Adelaide in 1890.

===University of Leeds===

[[Image:X-ray spectrometer, 1912. (9660569929).jpg|235px|thumb|X-ray spectrometer developed by Bragg]]
Bragg occupied the Cavendish chair of physics in the [[University of Leeds]] from 1909. He continued his work on X-rays with much success. He invented the [[X-ray spectrometer]] and with his son, [[William Lawrence Bragg]], then a research student at Cambridge, founded the new science of [[X-ray crystallography]], the analysis of crystal structure using X-ray diffraction.

From 1914, both father and son contributed to the war effort; W.H. Bragg was connected with submarine detection, at Aberdour on Forth and at Harwich, and returned to London in 1918 as a consultant to the admiralty.<ref name=dab/>

In 1915 father and son were jointly awarded<ref name=joint/> the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for their studies, using the X-ray spectrometer, of X-ray spectra, X-ray diffraction, and of crystal structure. Ten years later, their volume ''X-Rays and Crystal Structure'' (1915) had reached a fifth edition.<ref name=dab/>

===University College London===
Bragg was appointed [[Quain Professor]] of physics at [[University College London]] in 1915, but did not take up his duties there until after World War I. While Quain professor at London he continued his work on crystal analysis.<ref name=dab/>

===Royal Institution===
From 1923 he was Fullerian professor of chemistry at the [[Royal Institution]] and director of the Davy Faraday Research Laboratory.<ref name ="DFRL">[http://web.archive.org/web/20120211202445/http://www.rigb.org/contentControl?action=displayContent&id=00000000046 William Henry Bragg (1862–1942)]. The Davy Faraday Research Laboratory</ref> This institution was practically rebuilt in 1929–30 and, under Bragg's directorship, many valuable papers were issued from the laboratory.<ref name=dab/> In 1919, 1923 and 1925 he was invited to deliver the [[Royal Institution Christmas Lectures|Royal Institution Christmas Lecture]] on ''The World of Sound''; ''Concerning the Nature of Things'' and ''Old Trades and New Knowledge'' respectively.

==Legacy==
Bragg was elected [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1907, vice-president in 1920, and served as [[President of the Royal Society]] from 1935 to 1940.

The lecture theatre of [[King William's College]] (KWC) is named in memory of Bragg; the Sixth-Form invitational literary debating society at KWC, the Bragg Society, is also named in his memory. One of the school "Houses" at Robert Smyth School, Market Harborough, Leicester, is named "Bragg" in memory of him being a student there. Since 1992, the Australian Institute of Physics has awarded The Bragg Gold Medal for Excellence in Physics for the best [[PhD]] thesis by a student at an [[List of universities in Australia|Australian University]]. The two sides of the medal contain the images of Sir William Henry and his son Sir William Lawrence Bragg.<ref>{{cite web | title=Bragg Gold Medal for Excellence in Physics | url=http://www.aip.org.au/content/bragg | publisher=Australian Institute of Physics | year=2009 | accessdate=11 January 2009}}</ref>

In 1889 in Adelaide, W.H. Bragg married Gwendoline Todd, a skilled water-colour painter, and daughter of astronomer, meteorologist and electrical engineer Sir [[Charles Todd (astronomer)|Charles Todd]]. They had three children, a daughter, Gwendolen and two sons, (William) Lawrence (W.L.) and Robert. Robert was killed in the [[Battle of Gallipoli]]. W.H.'s wife Gwendoline died in 1929. W.H. Bragg died in 1942 in England and was survived by his daughter Gwendolen (Mrs. [[Alban Caroe]]) and his son, [[Sir William Lawrence Bragg]].

William H. Bragg was appointed [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) in 1917, Knight Commander ([[KBE]]) in 1920, and was admitted to the [[Order of Merit]] in 1931.<ref name=dab/>

The Experimental Technique Centre at [[Brunel University]] is named the Bragg Building.

In 1962, the Bragg Laboratories were constructed at The University of Adelaide to commemorate 100 years since the birth of Sir William H. Bragg.<ref name=dab/>
