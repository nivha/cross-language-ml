'''Sir Owen Willans Richardson''', [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] (26 April 1879 &ndash; 15 February 1959)  was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[physicist]] who won the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1928 for his work on [[thermionic emission]], which led to [[Thermionic emission#Richardson's Law|Richardson's Law]].<ref name="nobelbio">{{cite web | author=Nobel Foundation | title=Owen Willans Richardson: The Nobel Prize in Physics 1928  | url=http://www.nobel.se/physics/laureates/1928/richardson-bio.html | work=Les Prix Nobel | publisher= | year=1928 | accessdate=2007-09-17}}</ref>

==Biography==
Richardson was born in [[Dewsbury]], [[Yorkshire]], [[England]], the only son of Joshua Henry and Charlotte Maria Richardson. He was educated at [[Batley Grammar School]] and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where he gained First Class Honours in Natural Sciences.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{acad|id=RCRT897OW|name=Richardson, Owen Willans}}</ref> He then got a DSc from [[University College London]] in 1904.<ref name="ReferenceA"/><ref>[[List of Nobel laureates affiliated with University College London]]</ref>

After graduating in 1900, he began researching the emission of electricity from hot bodies at the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] in Cambridge, and in 1902 he was made a fellow at Trinity. In 1901, he demonstrated that the current from a heated wire seemed to depend exponentially on the temperature of the wire with a mathematical form similar to the [[Arrhenius equation]]. This became known as Richardson's law: "If then the negative radiation is due to the corpuscles coming out of the metal, the saturation current ''s'' should obey the law <math>s = A\,T^{1/2}\,e^{-b/T}</math>."<ref>O. W. Richardson (1901) [http://books.google.com/books?id=QAUPAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA286#v=onepage&q&f=false "On the negative radiation from hot platinum,"] ''Philosophical of the Cambridge Philosophical Society'', '''11''' : 286-295; see especially p. 287.</ref>

Richardson was professor at [[Princeton University]] from 1906 to 1913, and returned to the UK in 1914 to become Wheatstone Professor of Physics at [[King's College London]], where he was later made director of research. He retired in 1944, and died in 1959.

He also researched the [[photoelectric effect]], the [[Gyromagnetic ratio|gyromagnetic effect]], the emission of electrons by chemical reactions, soft [[X-rays]], and the spectrum of hydrogen.

Richardson married Lilian Wilson, sister of his Cavendish colleague [[Harold A. Wilson (physicist)|Harold Wilson]], in 1906, and had two sons and a daughter. Richardson's own sister married the American physicist (and 1937 Nobel laureate) [[Clinton Davisson]], who was Richardson's PhD student at Princeton. After Lilian's death in 1945, he was remarried in 1948 to Henriette Rupp, a physicist.

Owen Williams Richardson had a son Harold Owen Richardson who specialized in Nuclear Physics and was also the Chairman, Physics Department, Bedford College, London University and later on became emeritus Professor at London University.

==Honours==
Richardson became a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]] in 1913, and was awarded its [[Hughes Medal]] in 1920. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1928, "for his work on the thermionic phenomenon and especially for the discovery of the law named after him".<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1928/ Nobel prize citation, Nobel foundation website]</ref> He was knighted in 1939.
