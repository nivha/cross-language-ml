'''''Computational Science & Discovery''''' (CSD) is an [[international]], [[multidisciplinary]], [[peer-review]]ed journal focused on scientific advances and discovery through [[computational science]] in [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]] and [[applied science]]. It includes specific details of the enabling technologies used—for example, in data management, networking and visualization—that make the scientific advances possible.

The editor-in-chief is Nathan A Baker<ref>http://kdi.pnnl.gov/bios/baker.stm</ref> at [[Pacific Northwest National Laboratory]] WA, USA. He took over the role from Anthony Mezzacappa at [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]], TN, USA in 2011.<ref>http://www.knowledgespeak.com/newscategoryview.asp?category=Computational%20Science&id=12938</ref>
