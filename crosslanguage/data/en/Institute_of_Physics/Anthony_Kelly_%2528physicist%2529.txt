Kelly previously worked at the [[University of Cambridge]] with [[Mel West]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.humanities.manchester.ac.uk/aboutus/staff/ |title=Who's who (The University of Manchester) |publisher=Humanities.manchester.ac.uk |date=2011-09-01 |accessdate=2013-10-04}}</ref> and before that was a headteacher in [[Ireland]].

He was a leading figure in the movement to integrate and rationalise education in the Irish border region where he developed new governance structures.

Kelly was well known in [[Ireland]] because of his work in merging schools with different traditions, and is known in UK university circles for his traditional view of the role of universities. As a student at Cambridge he famously cast doubt on the sincerity of a student discussion (on Irish politics) in a student society,<ref>[[Cambridge Apostles#Former members]]</ref> causing some offence.

Kelly was founding editor of the [[academic journal|journal]] ''Education, Knowledge and Economy'',<ref name="TandfonlineCurrent">{{cite web|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/reke20/current|title=Taylor & Francis Online :: Education, Knowledge and Economy - Volume 5, Issue 3|publisher=tandfonline.com|accessdate=26 January 2014}}</ref> serves on the editorial board of other international academic journals, and is an invited lecturer at several leading universities outside the UK. He serves on several national UK steering groups and approval panels, and has appeared before the House of Commons Select Committee on Education. He also retains an interest and involvement in Anglo-Irish affairs. He is the author of approximately one hundred research reports, books and papers in leading academic journals.
