'''Dame (Susan) Jocelyn Bell Burnell''', [[Order of the British Empire|DBE]], [[Royal Society|FRS]], [[Royal Astronomical Society|FRAS]] (born 15 July 1943) is a [[People of Northern Ireland|Northern Irish]] [[astrophysics|astrophysicist]]. As a postgraduate student, she discovered the first radio [[pulsar]]s while studying and advised by her thesis supervisor [[Antony Hewish]],<ref name="1968a"/><ref name="1968b"/> for which Hewish shared the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] with [[Martin Ryle]], while Bell Burnell was excluded, despite having observed the pulsars.<ref name=Hargittai>{{cite book|last=Hargittai|first=István|title=The road to Stockholm : Nobel Prizes, science, and scientists|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0198607857|pages=240}}</ref>  Bell Burnell was [[President of the Royal Astronomical Society]] from 2002 to 2004, president of the [[Institute of Physics]] from October 2008 until October 2010, and was interim president following the death of her successor, [[Marshall Stoneham]], in early 2011. She was succeeded in October 2011 by [[Peter Knight (scientist)|Sir Peter Knight]].<ref name="microsoft">{{AcademicSearch|7647321}}</ref>

The paper announcing the discovery of pulsars had five authors. Hewish's name was listed first, Bell's second. Hewish was awarded the [[Nobel Prize]], along with [[Martin Ryle]], without the inclusion of Bell as a co-recipient. Many prominent astronomers expressed outrage at this omission,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/slideshow.cfm?id=10-nobel-snubs#6|title=No Nobel for You: Top 10 Nobel Snubs|date=6 October 2008|publisher=Scientific American|author=Erica Westly}}</ref> including Sir [[Fred Hoyle]].<ref name="nytimesnobel">{{cite news|title=No Nobel Prize for Whining|author=Judson, Horace|authorlink=Horace Freeland Judson|date=20 October 2003|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&res=9C02E4DE123EF933A15753C1A9659C8B63|publisher=''New York Times''|accessdate=3 August 2007}}</ref> The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, in their press release announcing the 1974 Nobel Prize in Physics,<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1974/press.html 1974 Nobel Physics Prize committee press release]</ref> cited Ryle and Hewish for their pioneering work in radio-astrophysics, with particular mention of Ryle's work on aperture-synthesis technique, and Hewish's decisive role in the discovery of pulsars. Dr. [[Iosif Shklovsky]], recipient of the 1972 [[Bruce Medal]], had sought out Bell at the 1970 [[International Astronomical Union]]'s General Assembly, to tell her: "Miss Bell, you have made the greatest astronomical discovery of the twentieth century."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Longair|first1=Malcolm|authorlink=Malcolm Longair|title=The Cosmic Century: A History of Astrophysics and Cosmology|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-47436-1|page=196}}</ref>

==Background and family life==
Susan Jocelyn Bell was born in [[Belfast]], [[Northern Ireland]]. Her father was an [[architect]] who had helped design the [[Armagh Planetarium]],<ref>{{cite news|last=Johnston|first=Colin|title=Pulsar Pioneer visits us|work=Astronotes|pages=2–3|publisher=[[Armagh Planetarium]]|date=March 2007|url=http://armaghplanet.com/pdf/Astronotes/Astronotes2007/Astronotes_Mar_2007.pdf|accessdate=2009-07-10|format=PDF}}</ref> and young Jocelyn soon discovered his books on [[astronomy]]. She grew up in [[Lurgan]] and attended [[Lurgan College]], where she, like the other girls, was not permitted to study science until her parents (and others) protested the school's policy. Previously, the girls' curriculum had included such subjects as cooking and [[cross-stitching]] rather than science.

She failed the [[11+ exam]] and her parents sent her to [[the Mount School, York]],<ref name="whoswho"/> a [[Quaker]] girls' boarding school.<ref>At Mount School 1956–61. She is the 2007 President of the [http://www.mosafriends.co.uk/#President Old Scholars' Association.]</ref> There she was favourably impressed by her physics teacher, Mr. Tillott, who stated: {{quote|You don't have to learn lots and lots&nbsp;... of facts; you just learn a few key things, and&nbsp;... then you can apply and build and develop from those&nbsp;... He was a really good teacher and showed me, actually, how easy physics was. {{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}}}

Bell Burnell was the subject of the first part of the [[BBC Four]] 3-part series ''Beautiful Minds'', directed by Jacqui Farnham, in which her career and contributions to astronomy were explored.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00ry9jq Beautiful Minds Jocelyn Bell Burnell]</ref>

==Academic career==
[[File:Chandra-crab.jpg|thumb|right|Composite Optical/X-ray image of the [[Crab Nebula]], showing [[synchrotron emission]] in the surrounding [[pulsar wind nebula]], powered by injection of magnetic fields and particles from the central pulsar.]]

Bell Burnell graduated from the [[University of Glasgow]] with a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in Natural Philosophy (physics) in 1965 and obtained a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] degree from [[University of Cambridge]] in 1969. At Cambridge, she worked with Hewish and others to construct<ref>''"...upon entering the faculty, each student was issued a set of tools: a pair of pliers, a pair of long-nose pliers, a wire cutter, and a screwdriver..."'', said during a public lecture in Montreal during the 40 Years of Pulsars conference, 14 August 2007</ref> a [[radio telescope]] for using [[interplanetary scintillation]] to study [[quasars]], which had recently been discovered (interplanetary scintillation allows compact sources to be distinguished from extended ones). In July 1967, she detected a bit of "scruff" on her [[chart recorder|chart-recorder]] papers that tracked across the sky with the stars. Ms. Bell found that the signal was  pulsing with great regularity, at a rate of about one pulse per second. Temporarily dubbed "Little Green Man 1" (LGM-1) the source (now known as [[PSR B1919+21]]) was identified after several years as a rapidly rotating [[neutron star]]. This was later documented by the BBC Horizon series (extract http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p009s61s)

Bell Burnell worked at the [[University of Southampton]] (1968–73), [[University College London]] (1974–82) and the [[Royal Observatory, Edinburgh]] (1982–91). In addition, from 1973 to 1987, she was a tutor, consultant, examiner, and lecturer for the [[Open University]].<ref name=CWP>{{cite web|title=Jocelyn Bell Burnell|publisher=Contributions of 20th Century Women to Physics (CWP)|url=http://cwp.library.ucla.edu/Phase2/Burnell,_Jocelyn_Bell@841234567.html|accessdate=2007-07-07}}</ref> She was Professor of Physics in the Open University from 1991 to 2001. She was also a visiting professor in [[Princeton University]] in the [[United States]] and Dean of Science in the [[University of Bath]] (2001–04),<ref>[http://www.bath.ac.uk/internal/news/bell_burnell.htm University of Bath Press Release, announcing Bell Burnell's retirement]</ref> and President of the [[Royal Astronomical Society]] between 2002 and 2004. She is currently Visiting Professor of Astrophysics in the [[University of Oxford]] and a Fellow of [[Mansfield College]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Queen's Birthday Honours 2007|publisher=[[University of Oxford]]|date=18 June 2007|url=http://www.admin.ox.ac.uk/po/news/2006-07/jun/18a.shtml|accessdate=2007-07-10}}</ref> She was President of the [[Institute of Physics]] between 2008 and 2010.<ref>[http://www.iop.org/about/governance/council/page_38744.html IoP website>Governance>Council (accessed 1 May 2008).]</ref>

==Non-academic life==
Bell is house patron of Burnell House at [[Cambridge House Grammar School]] in [[Ballymena]]. She has campaigned to improve the status and number of women in professional and academic posts in the fields of physics and astronomy.<ref>{{cite pmid| 15105461}} See also [http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/features/daily-features/article2652933.ece ''Belfast Telegraph'' interview]</ref>

===Quaker activities and beliefs===
From her school days, she has been an active [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] and served as [[Clerk (Quaker)|Clerk]] to the sessions of Britain Yearly Meeting in 1995, 1996 and 1997. She delivered a [[Swarthmore Lecture]] under the title ''Broken for life'',<ref>Details of the print version of the lecture are given in the Bibliography</ref> at [[Britain Yearly Meeting|Yearly Meeting]] in [[Aberdeen]] on 1 August 1989, and was the plenary speaker at the U.S. [[Friends General Conference]] Gathering in 2000.

She revealed her personal religious history and beliefs in an interview with [[Joan Bakewell]] in 2006.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/programmes/belief/scripts/jocelyn_bell_burnell.html Transcript of interview by Joan Bakewell for the BBC Radio 3 series "Belief" (2 January 2006)]</ref> She served on the [[Quaker Peace and Social Witness]] [[Religious Society of Friends#testimonies|Testimonies]] Committee, which produced ''Engaging with the Quaker Testimonies: a Toolkit'' in February 2007.<ref>''Engaging with the Quaker Testimonies: a Toolkit'', 2007  ISBN 0-901689-59-9</ref>

==Nobel Prize==
The fact that Bell did not receive recognition in the 1974 Nobel Prize in Physics has been a point of controversy ever since. She helped build<ref>BBC Radio 4 interview 25 October 2011</ref> the four-acre [[radio telescope]] over two years and initially noticed the anomaly, sometimes reviewing as much as 96 feet of paper data per night. Bell later claimed that she had to be persistent in reporting the anomaly in the face of scepticism from Hewish, who was initially insistent that it was due to interference and man-made. She spoke of meetings held by Hewish and Ryle to which she was not invited.<ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00s0ggv</ref> [[Sir Fred Hoyle|Fred Hoyle]] harshly criticized the Nobel committee, going so far as to accuse Hewish of stealing Bell's data. (Ironically, as some would later conjecture, it was this public outburst that would later cause Hoyle to be excluded from the 1983 Prize).<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2010/oct/03/fred-hoyle-nobel-prize Fred Hoyle: the scientist whose rudeness cost him a Nobel prize]</ref>

However, Bell has also been hesitant to express indignation at the omission. In an after-dinner speech made in 1977, she had the following to say on the matter:{{quote|There are several comments that I would like to make on this: First, demarcation disputes between supervisor and student are always difficult, probably impossible to resolve. Secondly, it is the supervisor who has the final responsibility for the success or failure of the project. We hear of cases where a supervisor blames his student for a failure, but we know that it is largely the fault of the supervisor. It seems only fair to me that he should benefit from the successes, too. Thirdly, I believe it would demean Nobel Prizes if they were awarded to research students, except in very exceptional cases, and I do not believe this is one of them. Finally, I am not myself upset about it -- after all, I am in good company, am I not! <ref>[http://cosmos.colorado.edu/stem/courses/common/documents/chapter7/Bell.html Quote by Bell Burnell regarding not sharing in the Nobel Prize]</ref>}}

==Awards==
