'''Sir Franz Arthur Friedrich Schuster''' [[Royal Society|FRS]]<ref>{{cite doi|10.1098/rsbm.1935.0006}}</ref> [[FRSE]] (12 September 1851 – 17 October 1934) was a [[Germany|German]]-born [[United Kingdom|British]] [[physicist]] known for his work in [[spectroscopy]], [[electrochemistry]], [[optics]], [[radiography|X-radiography]] and the application of [[harmonic analysis]] to [[physics]].

He contributed to making the [[University of Manchester]] a centre for the study of physics.

==Early years==
Arthur Schuster was born in [[Frankfurt|Frankfurt am Main]], Germany into a family of merchants and bankers. 

Schuster's parents were married in 1849, converted from Judaism to Christianity, and brought up their children in that faith. In 1869, his father moved to Manchester where the family textile business was based. Arthur, who had been to school in Frankfurt and was studying in [[Geneva]], joined his parents in 1870 and he and the other children became British citizens in 1875. [[Edgar Schuster]] (1897–1969) was his nephew.<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=|title=E. H. J. Schuster (1897–1969)|author=Paton, W. D. M. and Phillips, C. G. |journal=Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London|volume=28|issue=1 |year=1973|pages=111–117}}</ref>

From his childhood, Schuster had been interested in science and after working for a year for Schuster Brothers he persuaded his father to let him study at [[Victoria University of Manchester|Owens College]]. He studied mathematics under [[Thomas Barker (mathematician)|Thomas Barker]] and physics under [[Balfour Stewart]], and began research with [[Henry Enfield Roscoe|Henry Roscoe]] on the spectra of hydrogen and nitrogen. He spent a year with [[Gustav Kirchhoff]] at the [[Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg|University of Heidelberg]], and having gained his PhD, returned to Owens as an unpaid demonstrator in physics. Schuster later used his family's wealth to buy material and equipment and to endow readerships in mathematical physics at Manchester and meteorology at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]. He also contributed to the [[Royal Society]] and the International Union for Co-operation in Solar Research. 

After a further period of study in Germany with [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber]] and [[Hermann von Helmholtz]], he returned to England, where his knowledge of spectrum analysis led to him being appointed to lead an expedition to Siam, to photograph the coronal spectrum during the total [[solar eclipse of April 6, 1875|solar eclipse of 6 April 1875]]. This was an important appointment for such a junior scientist. On the way, he wrote a letter dated 21 February 1875, to ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' describing his observation of the "green flash" phenomenon.

==Career==
[[File:Arthur Schuster by William Orpen 1912.jpg|thumb|235px|Arthur Schuster by [[William Orpen]], 1912]]
On his return to Manchester, he began research on electricity and then went on to spend five years at the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] of the University of Cambridge. His status there was quite unofficial; he was neither a student nor a fellow. He worked with [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]] and with [[John Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh|Rayleigh]]. In 1881 he was appointed to the [[Beyer Chair of Applied Mathematics]] at Owens, by now one of the colleges of the new Victoria University. He succeeded his teacher Balfour Stewart as professor of physics in 1888. This appointment gave him the opportunity to establish a large, active teaching and research department. In 1900 a new laboratory, for which he had fought and which he had designed, was officially opened. It was the fourth largest in the world. The laboratory quickly became a serious rival to the Cavendish; see [[Victoria University of Manchester|Manchester Science Hall of Fame]]. Much of this later fame was associated with [[Ernest Rutherford]] who succeeded Schuster as Langworthy Professor in 1907. Schuster resigned from the chair, partly for health reasons and partly to promote the cause of international science. He ensured that Rutherford would succeed him. 

Schuster is credited with coining the concept of "antimatter" in  two letters to [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] in 1898.  He hypothesized antiatoms, and whole antimatter solar systems, which would yield energy if the atoms combined with atoms of normal matter. His hypothesis was given a mathematical foundation by the work of [[Paul Dirac]] in 1928, which predicted antiparticles and later led to their discovery.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1038/058367a0}}</ref><ref>Harrison, Edward (2000) [http://books.google.com/books?id=-8PJbcA2lLoC&printsec=frontcover ''Cosmology: the science of the universe''], 2nd ed., Cambridge University Press, pp. 266, 433, ISBN 0-521-66148-X.</ref>

Schuster is perhaps most widely remembered for his periodogram analysis, a technique which was long the main practical tool for identifying statistically important frequencies present in a time series of observations. He first used this form of harmonic analysis in 1897 to disprove [[Cargill Gilston Knott|C. G. Knott's]] claim of periodicity in earthquake occurrences. He went on to apply the technique to analysing [[sunspot]] activity. This was an old interest. In 1875 Stewart's friend and Roscoe's cousin, the economist [[William Stanley Jevons|Jevons]],  reported, "Mr. A Schuster of Owens College has ingeniously pointed out that the periods of good vintage in Western Europe have occurred at intervals somewhat approximating to eleven years, the average length of the principal sun-spot cycle."

Schuster is credited by [[Chandrasekhar]] to have given a fresh start to the [[radiative transfer]] problem. Schuster formulated in 1905 a problem in radiative transfer in an attempt to explain the appearance of absorption and emission lines in stellar spectra.

Following the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914, the Schuster family was subjected to anti-German prejudice in the press and, in Arthur's case, in some quarters of the Royal Society. His brother Sir [[Felix Schuster]] had to issue a statement pointing out the family's loyalty to Britain and that they all had sons serving in the British army. On the day Arthur gave his presidential address to the 1915 [[British Association]] meeting, he learned that his son had been wounded. 

Schuster was regarded by his contemporaries as a mathematical physicist of exceptional ability but also as a capable administrator and teacher, and an advocate for the role of science in education and industry.

==Honours and awards==
Schuster was elected to the [[Royal Society]] in 1879, and [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in the 1920 New Year Honours.<ref>{{LondonGazette |issue=31712 |date=30 December 1919 |startpage=3 |supp=yes}}</ref> Other honours include doctorates from the universities of Geneva (1909), St Andrews (1911), and Oxford (1917) and the award of the [[Royal Medal|Royal]], [[Rumford medal|Rumford]] and [[Copley medal|Copley]] medals of the Royal Society (1893, 1926 and 1931). 

Schuster served as secretary of the Royal Society and was elected vice-president (1919–20) and foreign secretary (1920–24). He also served as secretary of the [[International Research Council]] (1919–28) and on the management committees for the [[Meteorological Office]] (1905–32) and [[National Physical Laboratory, UK|National Physical Laboratory]] (1899–1902, 1920–25).

The University of Manchester's Physics building is named after Schuster.
