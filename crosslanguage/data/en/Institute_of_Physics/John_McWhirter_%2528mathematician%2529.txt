'''John G. McWhirter''' [[Royal Society|FRS]] [[Royal Academy of Engineering|FREng]] [[Fellow of the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications|FIMA]] [[Fellow of the Institute of Physics|FInstP]] [[FIEE]] [[Fellow of the Learned Society of Wales|FLSW]] is a [[United Kingdom|British]] mathematician and engineer in the field of [[signal processing]]. 

John McWhirter attended [[Newry High School]]. He graduated in mathematics from [[Queen's University Belfast]] in 1970, and gained a PhD there in 1973. He started working in the Signal Processing Group at the [[Royal Signals and Radar Establishment]], [[Great Malvern]], in the late 1970s, and has worked there for RSRE's successor organizations, currently [[QinetiQ]]. Prof. McWhirter left QinetiQ on 31 August 2007 to take up his current post as Distinguished Research Professor in Engineering at [[Cardiff University]].

His work has mainly been in military areas including [[radar]], [[sonar]] and communications, recently branching into civil applications. A particular interest is "blind" signal detection in which one does not know whether a signal is present, or its nature.
