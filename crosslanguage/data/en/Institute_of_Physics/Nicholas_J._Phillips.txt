'''Nicholas (Nick) John Phillips''' (26 September 1933 – 23 May 2009) was an English [[physicist]], notable for the development of photochemical processing techniques for the color [[hologram]]. Holograms typically used to have low [[signal-to-noise ratio]]s, and Phillips is credited as the pioneer of [[silver halide]] holographic processing techniques for producing high-quality reflection holograms.

==Career==
Phillips graduated with a [[Bachelor of Science|BSc]] degree in physics from [[Imperial College]], London. He was a senior researcher at the [[Atomic Weapons Research Establishment]] (AWRE), [[Aldermaston]], from 1959-1962. He was a research scientist at the [[Sperry_Corporation#Sperry_Rand|Sperry Rand Research Centre]], [[Sudbury, Massachusetts]], [[USA]], from 1962-1963. He was a theoretical physicist at [[English Electric]], [[Whetstone, Leicestershire|Whetstone]], [[Leicester]], [[UK]], from  1963-1965. From 1965-1993 he was appointed at [[Loughborough University]], where he rose to Professor of Applied Optics.  In October 1993, he was appointed as Professor of Imaging Science at [[De Montfort University]], [[Leicester]], [[UK]]. Phillips was the co-founder in the early 1970s of Holoco, who using lasers supplied by [[The Who]] (that had been used in laser light shows during their concerts), constructed the ''Light Fantastic'' exhibitions as [[Royal Academy|The Royal Academy of Arts]], London, in 1977-8. The company became Advanced Holographics in 1980 when The Who withdrew their financial backing, and was based in [[Loughborough]], [[UK]],<ref>M.

==Research and Achievements==
Phillips is credited with the development of bleaching and processing techniques, which made it possible to
record multi-color reflection holograms from a single wavelength [[laser]].<ref>D.

(1989), pp. 331-336.</ref> His research interests include holographic displays, edge-lit holograms, optical encoding for security, photopolymers, and novel micro-optic systems, and he has numerous patents in these areas.<ref>D.

==Holographic Art==
Phillips developed a technique for producing white light holograms that work in dim lighting conditions, which are now widely used in  the world of holographic art.<ref>[http://www.holonet.khm.de/benyonarchive/reviews/recoyl3.htm From Apparition, Holographic Art in Australia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Awards==
Phillips was awarded the [[Institute of Physics]] [[Young Medal and Prize|Thomas Young Medal]] (1981) in recognition for contributions to holography, particularly the development of high quality holograms for visual display.  He is a Fellow of the [[Institute of Physics]].
