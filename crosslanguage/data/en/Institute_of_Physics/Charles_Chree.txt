'''Charles Chree''' (5 May 1860 â€“ 12 August 1928) was a [[UK|British]] physicist, an authority on terrestrial magnetism and atmospheric electricity, and for 32 years Superintendent of Kew Observatory.<ref name="TimesObit"/>

Chree was born in Lintrathen, Forfarshire, Scotland on May 5, 1860, second son to Rev Charles Chree.<ref name="TimesObit">Obituary Dr Charles Chree, The Times  Tuesday Aug 14 1928</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Obituary:  Charles Chree|journal=Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society|date=October 1928|volume=54|issue=228|page=343|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.49705422812/abstract?systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+disrupted+on+23+February+from+10%3A00-12%3A00+BST+%2805%3A00-07%3A00+EDT%29+for+essential+maintenance|bibcode = 1928QJRMS..54..343B |doi = 10.1002/qj.49705422812 }}</ref>   He was educated at the Grammar School, Old Aberdeen, the [[University of Aberdeen]] where he graduated MA in 1879 and the [[University of Cambridge]] where he graduated as Sixth [[Wrangler (University of Cambridge)|Wrangler]] (MA, 1883).<ref name="TimesObit"/>

He was appointed Superintendent of [[Kew Observatory]] in 1893, a post he retained until 1925, a remarkably long period of 32 years.<ref name="TimesObit"/> During his tenure of office he was responsible for testing thousands of chronometers, watches, thermometers and other scientific instruments,<ref name="TimesObit"/> success in which tests gained the award of a "Kew Certificate".

Chree received degrees of D.Sc. from Cambridge in 1895 and LL.D. from Aberdeen in 1898.<ref name="TimesObit"/>

The [[Charles Chree Medal|Chree Medal and Prize]] of the [[Institute of Physics|IOP]] was named for him. The awards were renamed in 2008.

He died on Sunday 12 August 1928 in Worthing, Sussex. He was unmarried.<ref name="TimesObit"/>
