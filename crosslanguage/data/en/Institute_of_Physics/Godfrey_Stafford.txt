==Early life and the Navy==
*Stafford was born in England in 1920 but moved to South Africa at the age of 8. He attended the [[University of Cape Town]] where he came top of his class for Physics and subsequently did an MSc researching cosmic rays in 1941. He joined the South African Naval Forces as a Lieutenant Electrical Officer concerned with [[degaussing]] in the southern hemisphere.
*With the end of hostilities he entered [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge]], as [[Ebden|Ebden Scholar]] of the University of Cape Town, obtaining his Ph.D. in 1950.
*He later accepted a post with the [[Council for Scientific and Industrial Research|South African Council for Scientific and Industrial Research]] as the Head of its Biophysics Sub-Division. In 1954 after 2½ years in Pretoria, [[Rutherford Appleton Laboratory#Directors|Dr. Gerry Pickavance]] offered a job at [[Atomic Energy Research Establishment|Harwell]] in the Cyclotron Group.

==Rutherford Laboratory ==
*The Rutherford Laboratory came into being in 1957 with Gerry Pickavance as the first Director and  Stafford as the Head of the Proton Linear Accelerator (PLA) Group. The PLA achieved its first full energy beam in 1959. By 1963 with the PLA a well established machine he became responsible for the high energy physics programme for the [[Nimrod (synchrotron)]]. Stafford became Deputy Director on  1 April 1966. He has had close association with [[CERN]] and was a keen supporter of the idea of a [[European Physical Society]] and became a Member of the Steering Committee for its formation. He later acted as Scientific Secretary to the Organising Committee for the inaugural meeting of the Society which was held in Florence in April 1969. He succeeded Gerry Pickavance in 1969 as director of the Rutherford Laboratory.<ref name="two">{{cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutherford_Appleton_Laboratory#Directors |title=Rutherford Appleton Laboratory - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia |publisher=En.wikipedia.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-02}}</ref>
*During his time at the Rutherford labs he oversaw much expansion of the labs including the take over of the [[Atlas Computer Laboratory]] by the Rutherford Laboratory in 1975, and the development of superconducting '[[Rutherford Cable]]' for magnets in future CERN accelerators.<ref name="three">John Bertram Adams.

==Later work and titles==
Stafford was the second master of [[St Cross College]], Oxford from 1979 to 1987.<ref name=Birth /> He headed the [[European Physical Society]] in 1984 was made president of the [[Institute of Physics]] in 1986. He received a CBE for his services to science and was made a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1979.
