'''John Henry Poynting''' (9 September 1852{{spaced ndash}}30 March 1914<ref>GRO Register of Births: DEC 1852 8c 391 BARTON - John Henry Poynting, mmn = unknown</ref><ref>GRO Register of Deaths: MAR 1914 6d 128 KING'S N. - John Henry Poynting, aged 61</ref>) was an English [[physicist]]. He was a [[professor]] of [[physics]] at [[Mason Science College]], from 1880 to 1900, and then the successor institution, the [[University of Birmingham]] until his death.

Poynting was the youngest son of Thomas Elford Poynting, a [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] minister. In his boyhood he was educated at a school operated by his father. From 1867 to 1872 he attended [[Owen's College]], now the [[University of Manchester]], where his physics teachers included [[Osborne Reynolds]] and [[Balfour Stewart]]. From 1872 to 1876 he was a student at [[Cambridge University]], where he attained high honours in mathematics after taking grinds with [[Edward Routh]]. In the late 1870s he worked in the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] at Cambridge under [[James Clerk Maxwell]].<ref>[http://www.iop.org/activity/groups/subject/hp/Archive/Newsletters/page_22101.html John Henry Poynting's biography at Institute of Physics].</ref>

He was the developer and [[eponym]] of the [[Poynting vector]], which describes the direction and magnitude of [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] energy flow and is used in the [[Poynting theorem]], a statement about energy conservation for [[electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic field|magnetic]] fields. This work was first published in 1884. He performed a measurement of [[Isaac Newton|Newton's]] [[gravitational constant]] by innovative means during 1893. In 1903 he was the first to realise that the [[Sun]]'s radiation can draw in small particles towards it:<ref>{{cite book

He discovered the torsion-extension coupling in [[Finite strain theory|finite strain elasticity]]. This is now known as the (positive) [[Poynting effect]] in torsion.

Poynting and the Nobel prizewinner [[J. J. Thomson]] co-authored a multi-volume undergraduate physics textbook, which was in print for about 50 years and was in widespread use during the first third of the 20th century.<ref>For a lengthy though incomplete listing of the editions of Poynting and Thomson's ''Text-book of Physics'' see [http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=au%3Apoynting+au%3Athomson+ti%3Aphysics&fq=&dblist=638&se=yr&sd=asc&fc=yr:_50&qt=show_more_yr%3A Worldcat.org].</ref> Poynting wrote most of it.<ref>Reported in the biography of JJ Thomson by Davis & Falconer, previewable at [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=pBsg0DaZZQAC&pg=PA7 Google Book Search Preview].</ref>

Poynting lived at 11 St Augustine's Road, [[Edgbaston]] with his family and servants for some years.  He previously lived at 66 Beaufort Road, [[Edgbaston]] (demolished) and died of a diabetic coma{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}, aged 61, at 10 Ampton Road, Edgbaston in 1914.
