'''John William Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh''', [[Order of Merit|OM]], [[List of presidents of the Royal Society|PRS]] ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|eɪ|l|i}}; 12 November 1842&nbsp;– 30 June 1919) was an English [[physicist]] who, with [[William Ramsay]], discovered [[argon]], an achievement for which he earned the [[Nobel Prize for Physics]] in 1904. He also discovered the phenomenon now called [[Rayleigh scattering]], which can be used to explain why the sky is blue, and predicted the existence of the [[surface wave]]s now known as [[Rayleigh waves]]. Rayleigh's textbook,'' The Theory of Sound'', is still referred to by acoustic engineers today.

== Biography ==

John William Strutt, of Terling Place [[Essex]], suffered from frailty and poor health in his early years.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=The Popular Science Monthly |title=Sketch of Lord Rayleigh |pages=840 ''ff'' |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=fiwDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA840 |date=October 1884 |volume=25 |issue=46 |publisher=Bonnier Corporation}}</ref>   He attended [[Harrow School]], before going on to the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1861 where he studied mathematics at [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]]. He obtained a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree ([[Senior Wrangler]] and 1st [[Smith's prize]]) in 1865, and a [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|Master of Arts]] in 1868.<ref>

}}</ref> In 1873, on the death of his father, John Strutt, 2nd Baron Rayleigh, he inherited the [[Baron Rayleigh|Barony of Rayleigh]].

He was the second [[Cavendish Professor of Physics]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] (following [[James Clerk Maxwell]]), from 1879 to 1884. He first described [[dynamic soaring]] by [[seabirds]] in 1883, in the British journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''. From 1887 to 1905 he was Professor of [[Natural Philosophy]] at Cambridge.

Around the year 1900 Lord Rayleigh developed the ''duplex'' (combination of two) theory  of human sound localization using two [[binaural beats|binaural cues]], [[interaural time difference|interaural phase difference]] (IPD) and [[interaural level difference]] (ILD) (based on analysis of a spherical head with no external [[Pinna (anatomy)|pinnae]]). The theory posits that we use two primary cues for sound lateralization, using the difference in the phases of [[Sine wave|sinusoid]]al components of the sound and the difference in amplitude (level) between the two ears.

The [[rayl]] unit of acoustic impedance is named after him.

As an advocate that simplicity and theory be part of the scientific method, Lord Rayleigh argued for the [[principle of similitude]].

Lord Rayleigh was elected Fellow of the [[Royal Society]] on 12 June 1873, and served as president of the Royal Society from 1905 to 1908. From time to time Lord Rayleigh participated in the [[House of Lords]]; however, he spoke up only if politics attempted to become involved in science. He died on 30 June 1919, in [[Witham, Essex]].<ref name=prixnobel/>  He was succeeded, as the 4th Lord Rayleigh, by his son [[Robert John Strutt]], another well-known physicist.

== Religious views ==
Lord Rayleigh was an [[Anglican]]. Though he did not write about the relationship of science and religion, he retained a personal interest in spiritual matters.<ref>Peter J. Bowler (2014). "Reconciling Science and Religion: The Debate in Early-Twentieth-Century Britain", University of Chicago Press. p. 35</ref> When his scientific papers were to be published in a collection by the [[Cambridge University Press]], Strutt wanted to include a religious quotation from [[The Bible]], but he was discouraged to do so, as he later reported:
{{Quote|"When I was bringing out my ''Scientific Papers'' I proposed a motto from the [[Psalms]], ''"The Works of the Lord are great, sought out of all them that have pleasure therein."'' The Secretary to the Press suggested with many apologies that the reader might suppose that '' 'I' '' was the Lord."|<ref>Robert John Strutt Baron Rayleigh (1924). ''John William Strutt: Third Baron Rayleigh, O.M., F.R.S., Sometime President of the Royal Society and Chancellor of the University of Cambridge'', E. Arnold & Company, p. 307</ref><ref>lord Rayleigh (Robert John Strutt), John William Strutt Baron Rayleigh (1964). "An Appraisal of Rayleigh," Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories, Office of Aerospace Research, U.S. Air Force. p. 1150.</ref>}}
Still, he kept his wish and the quotation was printed in the five-volume collection of scientific papers.<ref>Richard Duncan (2008). "Elements of Faith", New Leaf Publishing Group., p. 77</ref>

In a letter to a family member, he also wrote about his rejection of [[materialism]] and spoke of [[Jesus Christ]] as a moral teacher:
{{Quote|"I have never thought the materialist view possible, and I look to a power beyond what we see, and to a life in which we may at least hope to take part. What is more, I think that [[Christ]] and indeed other spiritually gifted men see further and truer than I do, and I wish to follow them as far as I can."|Rayleigh (1910)<ref>Melba Phillips (1992), "The Life and Times of Modern Physics: History of Physics II". American Institute of Physics. p. 50</ref><ref>As quoted in R. J. Strutt. John William Strutt. p. 361. in "Reconciling Science and Religion: The Debate in Early-Twentieth-Century Britain", by Peter J. Bowler (2014). p. 35</ref><ref>Sir William Gavin (1967).

==Honours and awards==
[[Impact crater|Crater]]s on [[Mars]] and the [[Moon]] are named in his honour as well as a type of surface wave known as a [[Rayleigh waves|Rayleigh wave]]. The [[asteroid]] [[22740 Rayleigh]] was named in his honour on 1 June 2007.<ref>
