'''Professor Sir Colin John Humphreys''', [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (born 24 May 1941) is a British [[physics|physicist]]. He is the former Goldsmiths’ Professor of Materials Science and a current Director of Research at [[Cambridge University]], Professor of Experimental Physics at the [[Royal Institution]] in London and a Fellow of [[Selwyn College, Cambridge]]. He was President of the [[Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining]] in 2002 and 2003. His research interests include "all aspects of [[electron microscopy]] and analysis, semiconductors (particularly [[gallium nitride]]), ultra-high temperature aerospace materials and superconductors."<ref name=cam>University of Cambridge, [http://www-hrem.msm.cam.ac.uk/people/humphreys/ Colin Humphreys]</ref>

Humphreys also "studies the [[Bible]] when not pursuing his day-job as a [[materials scientist]]."<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/the-penultimate-supper/ | title= The Penultimate Supper? | date= April 17, 2011 | publisher= Cambridge University| accessdate=2011-04-23 | quote= The new study is based on earlier research which Professor Humphreys carried out with the Oxford astrophysicist, Graeme Waddington, in 1983. This identified the date of Jesus’ crucifixion as the morning of Friday, April 3rd, AD 33 – which has since been widely accepted by other scholars as well.  For Professor Humphreys, who only studies the Bible when not pursuing his day-job as a materials scientist, this presented an opportunity to deal with the equally difficult issue of when (and how) Jesus’ Last Supper really took place.}}</ref>

==Honours==
Humphreys was awarded the [[A. A. Griffith Medal and Prize]] in 2001 and a CBE in 2003 for services to science as a researcher and communicator.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=173836 |title= New year honours |publisher= Times Higher Education |date= January 3, 2003 |accessdate=2011-04-23}}</ref>  He was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in the [[2010 Birthday Honours]]<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=59446 |date=12 June 2010 |startpage=1 |supp=yes }}</ref> and in 2011 elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] <ref>{{cite web | url =http://royalsociety.org/people/colin-humphreys/ |title = Sir Colin John Humphreys CBE FREng FRS| publisher = Royal Society|accessdate = 2010-03-18}}</ref> He is also mentioned in Debrett's People of Today.<ref>[http://www.debretts.com/people/biographies/search/results/14261/Colin%20John%20HUMPHREYS.aspx Sir Colin Humphreys on Debrett's People of Today]</ref>

==Biblical study and publications==
In 2011 Humphreys claimed in his book ''The Mystery of the Last Supper'' that the [[Last Supper]] took place on Wednesday ([[Holy Wednesday]]), not as traditionally thought Thursday ([[Maundy Thursday]]), and the apparent timing discrepancies ([[Nisan]] 15 or 14) between the gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke versus John are rooted in the use of different calendars by the writers, the former group using an older Jewish calendar and the latter a lunar calendar.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/135477/20110418/colin-humphreys-last-supper-challenge-biblical-calendar-jewish-calendar-final-days-of-jesus-good-fri.htm |author=Staff Reporter |title=Last Supper was on Wednesday, not Thursday, challenges Cambridge professor Colin Humphreys.| publisher=[[International Business Times]] |date=18 April 2011 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}</ref> The Last Supper being on Wednesday would allow more time for interrogation and presentation to Pilate prior to the cruxification than given in the traditional view. Humphreys proposed the actual date for the Last Supper to be 1 April 33.

==Other activities==
Humphreys is a member of the [[John Templeton Foundation]].<ref name=cam/> and a member of the Advisory Council for the [[Campaign for Science and Engineering]].<ref name="CaSE Advisory Council">{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencecampaign.org.uk/about/who/advisory.htm|title=Advisory Council of the Campaign for Science and Engineering|accessdate=2011-02-11}}</ref>
