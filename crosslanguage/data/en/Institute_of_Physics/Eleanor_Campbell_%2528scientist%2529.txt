'''Eleanor Campbell''' [[Fellow of the Royal Society#Fellows|FRS]] [[Fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry|FRSC]] [[Fellow of the Institute of Physics|FInstP]] is a Professor of Physical Chemistry at [[Edinburgh University]]. Campbell was awarded the [[Fellow of the Royal Society#Fellows|FRS]] for her contribution to the understanding of relaxation channels and reorganisational dynamics of highly excited molecules and surfaces through experimental research<ref>{{cite web|title=Royal Society - Eleanor Campbell webpage|url=http://royalsociety.org/people/eleanor-campbell/}}</ref> in 2010.

==Early education==
Campbell was born and schooled on the [[Island of Bute|Island of Bute, Scotland]], Scotland. She was a former pupil of [[Rothesay Academy]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Academy graduate joins Royal Society - The Buteman|url=http://www.buteman.co.uk/news/local-headlines/academy-graduate-joins-royal-society-1-369496}}</ref>  She completed her first (1982) and doctorate degree in Edinburgh University (1985) before receiving a [[habilitation]] in experimental physics from [[Freiburg University|Freiburg University, Germany]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Biograpjhy of Eleanor Campbell on Edinburgh University Website|url=http://www.ecampbell.chem.ed.ac.uk/eleanor.html}}</ref>

==Academic career and accolades==
After her time as assistant professor at Freiburg University, she moved on to become the departmental head at the [http://www.mbi-berlin.de/ Max-Born-Institut]. In 1998 Eleanor was made Chair of Atomic and Molecular Physics at [[Gothenburg University|Gothenburg University, Sweden]] before returning to Edinburgh University in to take up a post as Chair of Physical Chemistry in 2007 and then Chemistry 2013.

== Current work ==
Campbell's group at Edinburgh describe themselves as working in the field of carbon nanomaterials. They use [[Ultrafast laser spectroscopy|femtosecond laser pulses]] to probe the ionisation dynamics of complex molecules using fullerene as a model system. Another way the group probe the properties of single molecules are through the help of plasmonic nanoantennas.<ref>{{cite web|title=NANOSPEC University of Edinburgh|url=http://www.ecampbell.chem.ed.ac.uk/nanospec/}}</ref> [[Electromagnetic radiation]] is redirected by the utilising the unique [[Plasmonics|surface plasmon]] properties of gold nanoparticles at the interfaces with [[carbon nanotube]]s in order to characterize their optical and electronic properties, similar to [[Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy|SERS]].
