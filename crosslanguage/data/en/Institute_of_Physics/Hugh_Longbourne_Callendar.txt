'''Hugh Longbourne Callendar''' [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] (18 April 1863 – 21 January 1930) was a [[UK|British]] [[physicist]].<ref>{{cite journal|title='''CALLENDAR, Hugh Longbourne'''|journal=Who's Who,|year=1907|volume=vol. 59|pages=p. 274|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=yEcuAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA274}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=A history of Imperial College London, 1907-2007|author=Gay, Hannah|location=London|publisher=[[Imperial College Press]]|page=176|url=http://books.google.com/books?isbn=1860947093}}</ref> He was born at [[Hatherop]] as the eldest son of the Reverend Hugh Callendar, a local [[Anglican]] rector. He married Victoria Mary Stewart in 1894, and the couple had three sons--Leslie Hugh Callendar, [[Guy Stewart Callendar]], and Max Victor Callendar--and a daughter, Cecil Callendar.

He was professor of physics at [[Royal Holloway College]] from 1888-93. He was then appointed Professor of Physics at [[Mcgill University|McGill University]] in [[Montreal]], Canada. Leslie, Cecil and Guy were born during this time at McGill. Hugh designed the first X-Ray experiments in Canada which produced satisfactory images used in hospitals. He returned to England in 1898 to assume the [[Quain Professor|Quain chair in physics]] at the [[Royal College of Science]] and was succeeded at McGill by [[Ernest Rutherford]], the "father" of nuclear physics, who wrote that Callendar was regarded as a "universal genius." In 1906 Callendar received the [[Rumford Medal]] for his experimental work on heat.

In 1907, Callendar took a professorship at [[Imperial College London|Imperial College, London]], where he would remain until his death in 1930. He did much research on the properties of steam at high temperatures, and during the first World War used x-ray imaging technology to improve aircraft engines.

Hugh's interests and hobbies included [[astronomy]], nature study, competitive shooting, [[gymnastics]], [[soccer]], [[tennis]], and handicraft, including automotive mechanics.

He died at home in [[Ealing]], of [[pneumonia]].<ref>The Callendar Effect: The Life and Work of Guy Stewart Callendar (1898–1964), the Scientist Who Established the Carbon Dioxide Theory of Climate Change, by [[James Rodger Fleming]] 2007</ref>

Among Callendar's inventions was a rolling-chart [[thermometer]] that allowed long-duration collection of climatic temperature data.
