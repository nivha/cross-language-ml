'''William Henry Eccles''' [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]]<ref name="frs"/> (23 August 1875 &ndash; 29 April 1966) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[physicist]] and a pioneer in the development of radio communication.

He was born in [[Barrow-in-Furness]], [[Lancashire]], [[England]]. Following graduation from the [[Royal College of Science]], [[London]], in 1898, he became an assistant to [[Guglielmo Marconi]], the Italian radio entrepreneur. In 1901 he received his doctorate from the Royal College of Science. Eccles was an advocate of [[Oliver Heaviside]]'s theory that a conducting layer of the upper atmosphere could reflect radio waves around the curvature of the Earth, thus enabling their transmission over long distances. Originally known as the [[Kennellyâ€“Heaviside layer]], this region of the Earth's atmosphere became known as the [[Ionosphere]]. In 1912 Eccles suggested that [[solar radiation]] was responsible for the observed differences in [[radio wave]] propagation during the day and night.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1098/rspa.1912.0061}}</ref> He carried out experiments into atmospheric disturbances of radio waves and used wave detectors and amplifiers in his work. Eccles invented the term [[Diode]] to describe an evacuated glass tube containing two electrodes; an [[anode]] and a [[cathode]].

Following [[World War I]] Eccles' main interest was in electronic circuit development. In 1918 he worked in collaboration with [[F. W. Jordan]] to patent the [[Flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop]] circuit, which became the basis of electronic memory in computers.<ref>William Henry Eccles and Frank Wilfred Jordan, "Improvements in ionic relays" British patent number: GB 148582 (filed: 21 June 1918; published: 5 August 1920).

Jordan (19 September 1919) "A trigger relay utilizing three-electrode thermionic vacuum tubes," ''The Electrician'', vol. 83, page 298.  Reprinted in: ''Radio Review'', vol. 1, no. 3 , pages 143&ndash;146 (December 1919).</ref> In 1919, Eccles became vice-chairman of the Imperial Wireless Committee. He helped in the design of the first [[long wave]] radio station, and became involved in the early work of the British Broadcasting Company (later the [[BBC]]) following its establishment in 1922.

William Eccles was a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] (FRS).<ref name="frs"/> He was President of the [[Physical Society]] from 1928 to 1930, President of the [[Institution of Electrical Engineers]] (IEE) in 1926, and President of the [[Radio Society of Great Britain]] (RSGB) in 1923-24.

He died in [[Oxford]].
