The '''Faraday Medal and Prize''' is a prize awarded annually by the [[Institute of Physics]]. The prize is awarded for "outstanding contributions to experimental physics, to a physicist of international reputation in any sector."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iop.org/about/awards/gold/faraday/page_38445.html|title=The Faraday medal|publisher=[[Institute of Physics]]|accessdate=2011-08-24}}</ref>

From 1914 to 1966 it took the form of the '''Guthrie Lecture''' after when it was replaced by the '''Guthrie Medal and Prize''', in memory of [[Frederick Guthrie]], founder of the [[Physical Society]] (which merged with the Institute of Physics in 1960). In 2008 the award was renamed the Faraday Medal and Prize, which is awarded annually for outstanding contributions to experimental physics to a physicist of international reputation in any sector. The medal is silver gilt and  accompanied by a prize of £1000 and a certificate.
