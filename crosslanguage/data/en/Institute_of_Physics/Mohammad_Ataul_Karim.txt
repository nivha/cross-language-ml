==Biography==

Born on May 4, 1953 in [[Sylhet]], [[Bangladesh]], he grew up in [[Barlekha]], a border town in Moulvibazar. He attended Shatma Primary for his elementary education and Patharia Chotolekha High for a year after which he left home to be schooled at [[Faujdarhat Cadet College]] (1965–1969), Sylhet [[MC College]] (1969–1972), and the [[University of Dhaka|University of Dacca]] (1972–1976) wherefrom he received his bachelors' honors degree in physics. Karim was admitted to the University of Alabama before his results from the University of Dacca were released. He moved to the United States in 1976 and earned his masters' degrees in physics (1978) and electrical engineering (1979), and a doctor of philosophy in electrical engineering (1982) from the [[University of Alabama]].<ref>http://www.umassd.edu/provost/people/mohammadkarim/</ref> 

Karim began creative writing in high school. A large number of his popular science writings in [[Bengali language|Bengali]] appeared in ''Bigyan Shamoeeki'' and ''Bangla Academy Bigyan Patrika'' during 1972–1976. Of these, the most significant were ''Biborthon Kahinee'', a series of articles on cosmic and biological evolution, and ''Shamproteek'', a monthly feature of current affairs in science, both of which appeared in ''Bigyan Shamoeeki''. By sophomore year in 1974, he had completed his first book manuscript which submitted to Bangla Academy for publication. After about two years, the Academy informed that it wasn’t prepared to take a chance on its juvenile author. This episode troubled him deeply ending his creative writing efforts in Bangla. All his subsequent books and articles were written in English and all were published from outside of Bangladesh. 

A 2004 Government of Bangladesh report<ref>http://publications.iom.int/bookstore/free/Diaspora_Linkage_Bangladeshis.pdf</ref> and a number of books in Bengali, including ''Bangladesher Shera Bigyani'' (Hitler A. Halim, ''Shikor'', 2004) and ''Medhabi Manusher Golpo'' ([[Mohammad Kaykobad]], ''Annyaprokash'', 2005), as well as Star Insight,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/starinsight/2011/07/01/index.htm |title=::: Star Insight ::: |publisher=Thedailystar.net |date=June 4, 2011 |accessdate=October 21, 2011}}</ref> cite him as an example of outstanding success of the Bangladeshi diaspora. His efforts to correct illegal practices that otherwise discriminated against international graduate students was featured by the [[Chronicle of Higher Education]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Wilson |first=Robin |url=http://chronicle.com/article/A-University-Uses-Quotas-to/9731/ |title=A University Uses Quotas to Limit and Diversify Its Foreign Enrollments - Faculty - The Chronicle of Higher Education |publisher=Chronicle.com |date=1999-05-14 |accessdate=2013-10-12}}</ref> [[Wall Street Journal]] in "Hidden Costs of a Brain Gain"<ref>{{cite web|author=By |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB983409306676287048.html |title=Hidden Costs of a Brain Gain - WSJ.com |publisher=Online.wsj.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-12}}</ref> and in turn by David Heenan in his book "Flight Capital: The Alarming Exodus of America's Best And Brightest". Karim is married with three children.
