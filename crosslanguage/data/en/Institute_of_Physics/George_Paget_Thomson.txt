==Education and early life==
Thomson was born in [[Cambridge]], England, the son of physicist and [[List of Nobel laureates in Physics|Nobel laureate]] [[J. J. Thomson]] and Rose Elisabeth Paget, daughter of [[George Edward Paget]]. Thomson went to [[The Perse School]], Cambridge before going on to read [[mathematics]] and [[physics]] at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], until the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914, when he was commissioned into the [[Queen's Royal West Surrey Regiment]]. After brief service in [[France]], he worked on [[aerodynamics]] at [[Farnborough Airfield|Farnborough]] and elsewhere. He resigned his commission as a [[Captain (land)|Captain]] in 1920.

==Career==
After briefly serving in the [[First World War]] Thomson became a [[Fellow]] at Cambridge and then moved to the [[University of Aberdeen]]. George Thomson was jointly awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Physics]] in 1937 for his work in Aberdeen in discovering the wave-like properties of the [[electron]]. The prize was shared with [[Clinton Joseph Davisson]] who had made the same discovery independently. Whereas his father had seen the electron as a [[Elementary particle|particle]] (and won his Nobel Prize in the process), Thomson demonstrated that it could be [[diffracted]] like a wave, a discovery proving the principle of [[wave-particle duality]] which had first been posited by [[Louis-Victor de Broglie]] in the 1920s as what is often dubbed the [[Matter wave|de Broglie hypothesis]].

In 1930 he was appointed Professor at [[Imperial College London]] in the chair of the late [[Hugh Longbourne Callendar]]. In the late 1930s and during the [[Second World War]] Thomson specialised in [[nuclear physics]], concentrating on practical military applications. In particular Thomson was the chairman of the crucial [[MAUD Committee]] in 1940–1941 that concluded that an [[atomic bomb]] was feasible. In later life he continued this work on nuclear energy but also wrote works on [[aerodynamics]] and the value of science in society.

Thomson stayed at Imperial College until 1952, when he became Master of [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]]. In 1964, the college honoured his tenure with the George Thomson Building, a work of modernist architecture on the college's [[Leckhampton, Corpus Christi College, Cambridge|Leckhampton]] campus.

==Awards and honours==
In addition to winning the Nobel Prize in Physics, Thomson was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in 1943.

==Personal life==
In 1924, Thomson married Kathleen Buchanan Smith, daughter of the [[George Adam Smith|Very Rev. Sir George Adam Smith]]. They had four children, two sons and two daughters. Kathleen died in 1941.
