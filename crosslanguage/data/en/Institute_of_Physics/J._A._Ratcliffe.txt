'''John Ashworth Ratcliffe''', [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]]<ref name="frs">{{cite doi|10.1098/rsbm.1988.0022}}</ref> (12 December 1902 &ndash; 25 October 1987), "JAR or Jack", was an influential British [[radio]] [[physicist]]. (Several sources misspell his name as Radcliffe)

He and his [[University of Cambridge]] group did much pioneering work on the [[ionosphere]], immediately prior to [[World War II]]. He was one of many leading radio scientists who worked at the [[Telecommunications Research Establishment]] during WW2. [[Martin Ryle]], [[Bernard Lovell]] and [[Antony Hewish]] were co-workers there, and Ryle and Hewish joined his radio-physics group at Cambridge after WW2. He was elected to the [[Royal Society]] in 1951.

In 1953 Ratcliffe was invited to deliver the [[Royal Institution Christmas Lectures|Royal Institution Christmas Lecture]] on ''The Uses of Radio Waves''.

He served as President of the [[Institution of Electrical Engineers]] from 1966 to 1967.

From 1960 to 1966 he was Director of the Radio & Space Research Station at [[Slough]].

Ratcliffe was awarded the [[Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society]] in 1976.
