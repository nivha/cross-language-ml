'''George Edward Bacon''' [[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|MA]] [[ScD]] (Cantab.) [[PhD]] (London) [[Institute of Physics|FInstP]] (born [[Derby]], [[England]], 5 December 1917  &ndash; 18 March 2011) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[nuclear physicist]], specializing in [[neutron diffraction]].

==Biography==
The son of George H. Bacon and Lilian A. Bacon, of Derby, he was educated at [[Derby School]] and [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge]] (Scholar). In 1945, he married Enid Trigg (who died in 2003), and they had a son and a daughter.

==Career==
Bacon built the first [[neutron]] [[diffractometer]] in the UK at the [[Atomic Energy Research Establishment]], [[Harwell, Oxfordshire|Harwell]], and then made the first experiments outside the [[United States]] in neutron diffraction, a means of studying the basic structures and dynamics of materials. He wrote scientific papers, textbooks and review articles on the use of neutron scattering.. His work included a study of the neutron intensities diffracted by crystals, which led to studies of the basic structure of molecules and of magnetism.  His book ''Neutron Diffraction'' was a standard text, beginning with the first edition in 1955. 

*1939–1946: Scientific Officer, Telecommunications Research Establishment of the [[Air Ministry]] 
*1946–1963: Deputy Chief Scientific Officer, [[Atomic Energy Research Establishment]], [[Harwell, Oxfordshire|Harwell]]
*1963-1981: Professor of Physics at the [[University of Sheffield]]
*1969–1971: Dean of the Faculty of Pure Science, University of Sheffield
*1981 to date: [[Emeritus professor]] of the University of Sheffield

==Honours==
*1988: [[Leverhulme Trust|Leverhulme]] Emeritus Fellow
*1999: [[Guthrie Medal and Prize]] and Fellow of the [[Institute of Physics]]
*1998: Honorary degree of [[Doctor of Science]] ([[University of Sheffield|Sheffield]])
