Rutherford became Director of the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge University in 1919. Under his leadership the [[neutron]] was discovered by [[James Chadwick]] in 1932 and in the same year the first experiment to split the nucleus in a fully controlled manner, performed by students working under his direction, [[John Cockcroft]] and [[Ernest Walton]]. After his death in 1937, he was honoured by being interred with the greatest scientists of the United Kingdom, near [[Sir Isaac Newton]]'s tomb in [[Westminster Abbey]]. The chemical element [[rutherfordium]] (element 104) was named after him in 1997.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Ernest Rutherford was the son of James Rutherford, a farmer, and his wife Martha Thompson, originally from [[Hornchurch]], [[Essex]], England.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|first=A.H.|last=McLintock|encyclopedia=An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand|title=Rutherford, Sir Ernest (Baron Rutherford of Nelson, O.M., F.R.S.)|edition=1966|date=18 September 2007|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/1966/rutherford-sir-ernest/1|publisher=Te Ara – The Encyclopaedia of New Zealand| isbn=978-0-478-18451-8|accessdate=2008-04-02}}</ref> James had emigrated to New Zealand from [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], Scotland, "to raise a little flax and a lot of children". Ernest was born at Spring Grove (now [[Brightwater]]), near [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]], New Zealand. His first name was mistakenly spelled 'Earnest' when his birth was registered.<ref>{{DNZB|last=Campbell|first=John|title=Rutherford, Ernest 1871–1937|id=3R37|accessdate=4 April 2011}}</ref>

He studied at [[Havelock School, New Zealand|Havelock School]] and then [[Nelson College]] and won a [[Bursary|scholarship]] to study at [[University of Canterbury#History|Canterbury College]], [[University of New Zealand]] where he participated in the [[debating society]] and played [[rugby football|rugby]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|first=John|last=Campbell|encyclopedia=An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand|title=Rutherford, Ernest|date=30 October 2012|url=http://www.TeAra.govt.nz/en/biographies/3r37/rutherford-ernest|publisher=Te Ara – The Encyclopaedia of New Zealand|accessdate=2013-10-01}}</ref> After gaining his BA, [[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|MA]] and BSc, and doing two years of research during which he invented a new form of radio receiver, in 1895 Rutherford was awarded an [[1851 Research Fellowship]] from the [[Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851]],<ref>1851 Royal Commission Archives</ref> to travel to England for postgraduate study at the [[Cavendish Laboratory]], [[University of Cambridge]].<ref>{{acad|id=RTRT895E|name=Rutherford, Ernest}}</ref> He was among the first of the 'aliens' (those without a Cambridge degree) allowed to do research at the university, under the inspiring leadership of [[J. J. Thomson]], and the newcomers aroused jealousies from the more conservative members of the Cavendish fraternity. With Thomson's encouragement, he managed to detect radio waves at half a mile and briefly held the world record for the distance over which electromagnetic waves could be detected, though when he presented his results at the [[British Association]] meeting in 1896, he discovered he had been outdone by another lecturer, by the name of [[Guglielmo Marconi|Marconi]].

In 1898 Thomson offered Rutherford the chance of a post at [[McGill University]] in [[Montreal]], Canada. He was to replace [[Hugh Longbourne Callendar]] who held the [[William Christopher Macdonald|chair of Macdonald Professor of physics]] and was coming to Cambridge.<ref>
{{cite book|first=Robin|last=McKown|title=Giant of the Atom, Ernest Rutherford|year=1962|publisher=Julian Messner Inc, New York|page=57|ref=harv}}
</ref> Rutherford was accepted, which meant that in 1900 he could marry Mary Georgina Newton (1876–1945) to whom he had become engaged before leaving New Zealand; they had one daughter, Eileen Mary (1901–1930), who married [[Ralph Fowler]]. In 1900 he gained a [[DSc]] from the University of New Zealand. In 1907 Rutherford returned to Britain to take the [[Chair (academic department)|chair]] of physics at the [[University of Manchester]].

===Later years and honours===
He was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in 1914. During World War I, he worked on the practical problems of submarine detection. In 1916 he was awarded the [[Hector Memorial Medal]]. In 1919 he returned to the Cavendish succeeding J. J. Thomson as the Cavendish professor and Director. Under him, Nobel Prizes were awarded to [[James Chadwick]] for discovering the neutron (in 1932), [[John Cockcroft]] and [[Ernest Walton]] for an experiment which was to be known as ''splitting the atom'' using a [[particle accelerator]], and [[Edward Victor Appleton|Edward Appleton]] for demonstrating the existence of the [[ionosphere]]. Between 1925 and 1930 he served as [[President of the Royal Society]], and later as president of the [[Council for Assisting Refugee Academics|Academic Assistance Council]] which helped almost 1,000 university refugees from Germany.<ref>

For some time beforehand, Rutherford had a small [[hernia]], which he had neglected to have fixed, and it became strangulated, causing him to be violently ill.  Despite an emergency operation in London, he died four days afterwards of what physicians termed "intestinal paralysis", at Cambridge.<ref name=compeerage>{{cite book|title=The Complete Peerage, Volume XIII – Peerage Creations, 1901–1938|year=1949|publisher=St Catherine's Press|page=495}}</ref>  After cremation at [[Golders Green Crematorium]],<ref name=compeerage />  he was given the high honour of burial in [[Westminster Abbey]], near [[Isaac Newton]] and other illustrious British scientists.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=_vNW1wg9npgC&pg=PA123&dq=ernest+rutherford+death+titled&hl=en&sa=X&ei=QrEDT_7WBMKhtwfruMHRBg&ved=0CDoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=ernest%20rutherford%20death%20titled&f=false Heilbron, J.

==Scientific research==
[[File:Sir Ernest Rutherfords laboratory, early 20th century. (9660575343).jpg|thumb|right|The laboratory of Rutherford, early 20th century]]
At Cambridge, Rutherford started to work with J. J. Thomson on the conductive effects of X-rays on gases, work which led to the discovery of the [[electron]] which Thomson presented to the world in 1897. Hearing of [[Henri Becquerel|Becquerel]]'s experience with [[uranium]], Rutherford started to explore its [[radioactivity]], discovering two types that differed from X-rays in their penetrating power. Continuing his research in Canada, he coined the terms [[alpha ray]] and [[beta ray]] in 1899 to describe the two distinct types of [[radioactivity|radiation]]. He then discovered that [[thorium]] gave off a gas which produced an emanation which was itself radioactive and would coat other substances. He found that a sample of this radioactive material of any size invariably took the same amount of time for half the sample to decay – its "[[half-life]]" (11½ minutes in this case).

From 1900 to 1903, he was joined at McGill by the young chemist [[Frederick Soddy]] ([[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]], 1921) for whom he set the problem of identifying the thorium emanations. Once he had eliminated all the normal chemical reactions, Soddy suggested that it must be one of the inert gases, which they named [[thoron]] (later found to be an isotope of [[radon]]). They also found another type of thorium they called Thorium X, and kept on finding traces of helium. They also worked with samples of "Uranium X" from [[William Crookes]] and [[radium]] from [[Marie Curie]].

In 1902, they produced a "Theory of Atomic Disintegration" to account for all their experiments. Up till then atoms were assumed to be the indestructable basis of all matter and although Curie had suggested that radioactivity was an atomic phenomenon, the idea of the atoms of radioactive substances breaking up was a radically new idea. Rutherford and Soddy demonstrated that radioactivity involved the spontaneous disintegration of [[atom]]s into other types of atoms (one element spontaneously being changed to another).

In 1903, Rutherford considered a type of radiation discovered (but not named) by French chemist [[Paul Villard]] in 1900, as an emission from [[radium]], and realised that this observation must represent something different from his own alpha and beta rays, due to its very much greater penetrating power. Rutherford therefore gave this third type of radiation the name of [[gamma ray]]. All three of Rutherford's terms are in standard use today – other types of [[radioactive decay]] have since been discovered, but Rutherford's three types are among the most common.

In Manchester, he continued to work with alpha radiation. In conjunction with [[Hans Geiger]], he developed zinc sulfide [[zinc sulfide|scintillation screens]] and ionisation chambers to count alphas. By dividing the total charge they produced by the number counted, Rutherford decided that the charge on the alpha was two. In late 1907, Ernest Rutherford and [[Thomas Royds]] allowed alphas to penetrate a very thin window into an evacuated tube. As they [[atomic emission spectroscopy|sparked the tube into discharge]], the spectrum obtained from it changed, as the alphas accumulated in the tube. Eventually, the clear spectrum of helium gas appeared, proving that alphas were at least ionised helium atoms, and probably helium nuclei.

===Rutherford and the Gold Foil Experiment===
[[File:Gold foil experiment conclusions.svg|right|upright|thumb|''Top:'' Expected results: [[alpha particle]]s passing through the [[plum pudding model]] of the atom undisturbed.<br>
''Bottom:'' Observed results: a small portion of the particles were deflected, indicating [[Atomic nucleus|a small, concentrated charge]]. Note that the image is not to scale; in reality the nucleus is vastly smaller than the electron shell.]]
Rutherford performed his most famous work ''after'' receiving the Nobel prize in 1908. Along with [[Hans Geiger]] and [[Ernest Marsden]] in 1909, he carried out the [[Geiger–Marsden experiment]], which demonstrated the nuclear nature of atoms by deflecting [[alpha particles]] passing through a thin gold foil. Rutherford was inspired to ask Geiger and Marsden in this experiment to look for alpha particles with very high deflection angles, of a type not expected from any theory of matter at that time. Such deflections, though rare, were found, and proved to be a smooth but high-order function of the deflection angle. It was Rutherford's interpretation of this data that led him to formulate the [[Rutherford model]] of the atom in 1911 – that a very small [[charge (physics)|charged]] <ref name=charge /> [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]], containing much of the atom's mass, was [[orbit]]ed by low-mass [[electrons]].

Before leaving Manchester in 1919 to take over the Cavendish laboratory in Cambridge, Rutherford became, in 1919, the first person to deliberately transmute one [[chemical element|element]] into another.<ref name=nobelprize>{{cite web|title=Ernest Rutherford – Biography|url=http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1908/rutherford.html|publisher=NobelPrize.org|accessdate=21 February 2013}}</ref>  In this experiment, he had discovered peculiar radiations when alphas were projected into air, and narrowed the effect down to the nitrogen, not the oxygen in the air. Using pure nitrogen, Rutherford used alpha radiation to convert [[nitrogen]] into [[oxygen]] through the [[nuclear reaction]] <sup>14</sup>N + α → <sup>17</sup>O + proton. The proton was not then known. In the products of this reaction Rutherford simply identified hydrogen nuclei, by their similarity to the particle radiation from earlier experiments in which he had bombarded hydrogen gas with alpha particles to knock hydrogen nuclei out of hydrogen atoms. This result showed Rutherford that hydrogen nuclei were a part of nitrogen nuclei (and by inference, probably other nuclei as well). Such a construction had been suspected for many years on the basis of atomic weights which were whole numbers of that of hydrogen; see [[Prout's hypothesis]]. Hydrogen was known to be the lightest element, and its nuclei presumably the lightest nuclei. Now, because of all these considerations, Rutherford decided that a hydrogen nucleus was possibly a fundamental building block of all nuclei, and also possibly a new fundamental particle as well, since nothing was known from the nucleus that was lighter. Thus, Rutherford postulated hydrogen nuclei to be a new particle in 1920, which he dubbed the ''[[proton]]''.

In 1921, while working with [[Niels Bohr]] (who postulated that electrons moved in specific orbits), Rutherford theorized about the existence of [[neutron]]s, (which he had christened in his 1920 [[Bakerian Lecture]]), which could somehow compensate for the repelling effect of the positive charges of [[proton]]s by causing an attractive [[nuclear force]] and thus keep the nuclei from flying apart from the repulsion between protons. The only alternative to neutrons was the existence of "nuclear electrons" which would counteract some of the proton charges in the nucleus, since by then it was known that nuclei had about twice the mass that could be accounted for if they were simply assembled from hydrogen nuclei (protons). But how these nuclear electrons could be trapped in the nucleus, was a mystery.

Rutherford's theory of [[neutron]]s was proved in 1932 by his associate [[James Chadwick]], who recognized neutrons immediately when they were produced by other scientists and later himself, in bombarding beryllium with alpha particles. In 1935, Chadwick was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for this discovery.

===Nuclear physics===
Rutherford's research, and work done under him as laboratory director, established the nuclear structure of the atom and the essential nature of radioactive decay as a nuclear process. Rutherford's team, using natural alpha particles, demonstrated ''induced'' [[nuclear transmutation]], and later, using protons from an accelerator, demonstrated ''artificially-induced'' nuclear reactions and transmutation. He is known as the father of nuclear physics. Rutherford died too early to see [[Leó Szilárd]]'s idea of controlled [[nuclear chain reaction]]s come into being. However, a speech of Rutherford's about his artificially-induced transmutation in lithium, printed in the 12 September 1933 London paper ''[[The Times]]'', was reported by Szilárd to have been his inspiration for thinking of the possibility of a controlled energy-producing [[nuclear chain reaction]]. Szilard had this idea while walking in London, on the same day.

Rutherford's speech touched on the 1932 work of his students [[John Cockcroft]] and [[Ernest Walton]] in "splitting" lithium into alpha particles by bombardment with protons from a particle accelerator they had constructed. Rutherford realized that the energy released from the split lithium atoms was enormous, but he also realized that the energy needed for the accelerator, and its essential inefficiency in splitting atoms in this fashion, made the project an impossibility as a practical source of energy (accelerator-induced fission of light elements remains too inefficient to be used in this way, even today). Rutherford's speech in part, read:

{{quote|We might in these processes obtain very much more energy than the proton supplied, but on the average we could not expect to obtain energy in this way. It was a very poor and inefficient way of producing energy, and anyone who looked for a source of power in the transformation of the atoms was talking moonshine. But the subject was scientifically interesting because it gave insight into the atoms.<ref>[http://archive.timesonline.co.uk/ The Times archives], 12 September 1933, "The British association – breaking down the atom"</ref>}}

The [http://www.psych-sci.manchester.ac.uk/aboutus/maps/coupland1/ Coupland Building] at [[Manchester University]], at which Rutherford conducted many of his experiments, has been the subject of a [[cancer cluster]] investigation.  There has been a statistically high incidence of [[pancreatic cancer]], [[brain cancer]], and [[motor neuron disease]] occurring in and around Rutherford's former laboratories and, since 1984, a total of six workers have been stricken with these ailments.  In 2009, an independent commission concluded that the very slightly elevated levels of various radiation related to Rutherford's experiments decades earlier are not the likely cause of such cancers and ruled the illnesses a coincidence.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.com/news/2009/090930/full/news.2009.965.html |title= Rutherford Building cancers a 'coincidence' |author= Geoff Brumfiel |date= September 30, 2009 |accessdate= November 28, 2013}}</ref>
