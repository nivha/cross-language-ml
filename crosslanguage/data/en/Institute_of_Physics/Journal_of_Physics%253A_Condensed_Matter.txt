==Former titles history==
This journal was formed by a merger of ''Journal of Physics C: Solid State Physics'' (1968–1988) and ''Journal of Physics F: Metal Physics'' (1971–1988).

This publication is also derived from the following former titles, either partially, or from a past, total merger: ''Metal Physics'' (1970);  ''Proceedings of the Physical Society'' (1958–1967); ''Proceedings of the Physical Society. Section A'' (1949–1957); ''Proceedings of the Physical Society. Section B'' (1949–1957); ''Proceedings of the Physical Society'' (1926–1948); ''Proceedings of the Physical Society'' (1874–1925); and  ''Transactions of the Optical Society''  (1899–1931)<ref name=cassi>[http://cassi.cas.org/search.jsp CASSI Source index].
