'''David C. Larbalestier''' is an American scientist who is known for his research in [[superconducting]] materials for [[magnet]]s and power applications. He is currently a Professor of Mechanical Engineering and Director of the Applied Superconductivity Center at the [[National High Magnetic Field Laboratory]] at [[Florida State University]].  He also holds emeritus status in the Materials Science and Engineering department at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], which was his academic home until 2006.  He is a member of the [[National Academy of Engineering]].  His materials research interests have led to improvements in the superconducting properties of many materials, including [[niobium-titanium|NbTi]], [[niobium-tin|Nb<sub>3</sub>Sn]], [[Magnesium diboride|MgB<sub>2</sub>]], [[YBCO]], and [[BSCCO]].
