== History ==

Dedicated to the late [[Ernest Rutherford|Lord Rutherford of Nelson]], the '''Rutherford Memorial Lecture''' was instituted by the Council of The Physical Society in 1939. The first lecture took place in 1942.<ref name=History>[http://www.iop.org/activity/awards/Subject_Awards/The_Rutherford_Medal_and_Prize/page_1789.html History], The Rutherford Medal and Prize, [[Institute of Physics]].</ref> The lecture was converted into a medal and prize in 1965, and the first Rutherford Medal and Prize was awarded the following year.<ref name=History/>

"The award shall be made for distinguished research in nuclear physics or nuclear technology. The medal shall be bronze and shall be accompanied by a prize of £1000 and a certificate."<ref name=History/>
