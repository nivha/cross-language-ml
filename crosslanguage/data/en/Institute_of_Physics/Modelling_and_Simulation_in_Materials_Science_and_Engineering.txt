'''''Modelling and Simulation in Materials Science and Engineering''''' is a [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[scientific journal]] published by the [[IOP Publishing]] eight times per year. 

The journal covers properties, structure, and behavior of all classes of materials at scales from the [[atom]]ic to the [[macroscopic scale|macroscopic]]. This includes electronic structure/properties of materials determined by ab initio and/or semi-empirical methods, atomic level properties of materials, microstructural level phenomena, continuum-level modelling pertaining to material behaviour, and modelling behaviour in service. Mechanical, microstructural, electronic, chemical, biological, and optical properties of materials are also of interest.

The [[editor-in-chief]] is William A. Curtin ([[École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne]], Switzerland).
