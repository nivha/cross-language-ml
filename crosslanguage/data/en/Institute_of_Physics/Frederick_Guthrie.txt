'''Frederick Guthrie''' (1833–1886) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] scientific writer and professor.  He is the younger brother of mathematician [[Francis Guthrie]]. With [[William Fletcher Barrett]] he helped found the [[Physical Society of London]] (now the [[Institute of Physics]]) in 1874 and was president of the society from 1884 till 1886.<ref>{{cite book|author= Lewis, John J. |title= The Physical Society and Institute of Physics 1874-2002|publisher= Institute of Physics Publishing|year=2003 |isbn=0-7503-0879-6}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.iop.org/about/history/page_38385.html| title = Institute History|publisher= IOP|accessdate = 29 September 2012}}</ref> He believed that science should be based on experimentation rather than discussion.  

==Academic Career==
His academic career started at [[University College, London]], where he studied for three years, he was devoted to the studying chemistry, under [[Thomas_Graham_(chemist)|Thomas Graham]] and [[Alexander William Williamson]], and also studied mathematics under [[Augustus De Morgan]]. In 1852, after his brother [[Francis Guthrie]]'s death, he submitted his brothers observations to [[De Morgan]]. <ref>{{cite book|author= Fritsch, Rudolf and Fritsch, Gerda |title= The Four Color Theorem: History, Topological Foundations, and Idea of Proof|publisher= Springer|year=1998 |isbn=0-387-98497-6}}</ref>

In 1854 Guthrie went to [[Heidelberg]] studying under [[Robert Bunsen]] and then in 1855 obtained a Ph.D. at the [[University of Marburg]] under [[Adolph Wilhelm Hermann Kolbe]]. <ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v35/n888/abs/035008e0.html| title = "Frederick Guthrie",Editorial, Nature 35, 8-10 (04 November 1886)|publisher= Nature|accessdate = 29 September 2012| doi=10.1038/035008e0}}</ref> 

In 1856 he joined [[Edward Frankland]], Professor of Chemistry in Owens College, Manchester. In 1859 he went to Edinburgh University.

Guthrie was the first to report on the effects of [[mustard gas]]. In 1860, he described combining [[ethylene]] with [[sulfur dichloride]] and observations of some of the physiological effects it had on him.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Guthrie, Frederick |title=XIII.—On some derivatives from the olefines |journal=Q. J. Chem. Soc. |volume=12 |pages=109–126 |year=1860 |doi=10.1039/QJ8601200109 |issue=1 }}</ref> 

He became professor in chemistry and physics, at the Royal College of Mauritius between 1861 and 1867.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v132/n3337/abs/132595b0.html| title = "Guthrie and the Physical Society", News, Nature 132, 595-596 (14 October 1933)|publisher= Nature|accessdate = 29 September 2012| doi=10.1038/132595b0}}</ref>

He was also a professor at the [[Royal School of Mines]], where he mentored the future experimental physicist [[C. V. Boys]]. He also mentored [[John Ambrose Fleming]] and was instrumental in turning his interest from chemistry to electricity.

He wrote the ''Elements of Heat'' in 1868 and ''Magnetism and Electricity'' in 1873. Published in 1876 London and Glasgow, William collins, sons, & Company

Guthrie was also a linguist, playwright, and poet.  Under the name Frederick Cerny, he wrote the poems ''The Jew'' (1863) and ''Logrono'' (1877). His son was [[Frederick Bickell Guthrie]], an agricultural chemist.
