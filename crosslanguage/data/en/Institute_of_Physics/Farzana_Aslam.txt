After her M.Sc., she later received her [[Master of Philosophy]] (M.Phil.) in [[Laser Physics|Laser]] and [[Quantum Physics]] from the same institute. Farazan then travelled to [[United Kingdom]] to attend the [[University of Manchester]]. In 2005, she received her double [[PhD]]s in [[physics]] and [[astronomy]] from [[School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Manchester]]. In 2005, she joined a vibrant physics group "Photon Physics Group" at the School of Physics and Astronomy where she specialised in [[Two-photon physics]] and [[Photonics|Laser Photonics]].<ref>http://www.prideofpakistan.com:8080/maincontroller?requestId=4&userId=184</ref> She received her Ph.D. in laser physics in 2005.<ref>{{Citation

==Career in physics==
After her master's degree in physics, Aslam joined [[University of the Punjab]] as a lecturer where she has taught [[undergraduate]] and [[post-graduate]] level physics.<ref>{{Cite web

</ref> Since she has joined [[School of Physics and Astronomy]] at the Manchester University, she has been a vital researcher to the field of [[Ionic polymer-metal composite|polymer composite]] sensitised with [[semiconductor]] [[nanoparticles]], in order to achieve high response rate and [[diffraction]] efficiency as required for applications as data storage and processing. She has also taught undergraduate level mathematics and tutoring mathematics and physics to the university students.<ref>{{Cite web

Furthermore, she has also been actively involved in the outreach program through the Ogden Teaching Fellowship for the widening participation in engineering and physical sciences scheme of the University of Manchester. The purpose of this fellowship is to involve working scientists as role models for kids into the UK government schools to encourage young generation to study science and engineering. Due to her contribution, she was awarded a commendation award at the Photon 04 conference held by [[Institute of Physics]] at Glasgow from 5–9 September 2004.

==Views on Pakistani women==
Farzana believes strongly that [[Pakistani women]] have great intellect and potential to participate in every profession. They can contribute positively towards the development of society and can play a vital role to build it on healthier and stronger foundations. They should realise their full potential in all spheres of life, especially personal, social, economic and political and should realise that they can attain all these along with maintaining their Islamic values.
