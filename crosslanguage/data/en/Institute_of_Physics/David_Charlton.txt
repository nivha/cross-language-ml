}}'''David G. Charlton''' [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] is [[Professor]] of [[Particle Physics]] in the School of [[Physics]] and [[Astronomy]] at the [[University of Birmingham]], UK.<ref name="microsoft">{{AcademicSearch|5078914}}</ref><ref name="scopus">{{Scopus|id=7103267315}}</ref>

==Education==
Charlton was educated at the University of Oxford, graduating with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in Physics in 1985. He went on to study for a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in Particle Physics, which he was awarded in 1989<ref>[http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/physics/charlton-david.aspx David Charlton FRS, Professor of Particle Physics], University of Birmingham</ref> for work on the [[UA1 experiment]], searching for the [[top quark]].

==Research==
Charlton's research investigates the [[Higgs mechanism]] and electroweak symmetry breaking.<ref>{{YouTube|id=ySPiFxLdpAc|title=The Search for the Higgs Boson at the University of Birmingham with David Charlton and Paul Newman}}</ref><ref>{{cite doi|10.1007/BF02907439|noedit}}</ref><ref>{{cite doi|10.1016/0370-2693(89)90705-3|noedit}}</ref><ref>{{cite doi|10.1007/BF01496577|noedit}}</ref><ref>{{cite doi|10.1007/BF01560437|noedit}}</ref><ref>{{cite doi|10.1016/0550-3213(90)90493-W|noedit}}</ref> His research has been funded by the [[Science and Technology Facilities Council|Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC)]].<ref>[http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/person/51D50242-08E9-4FCC-8B65-224DEA840B49 Research grants awarded to David Charlton] Research Councils UK</ref>

==Career==
Charlton has been the spokesperson of the ATLAS Collaboration since March 2013. During the construction of the ATLAS experiment, he worked on hybrid [[Readout integrated circuit|readout circuits]] for the silicon strip sensors of the Semiconductor Tracker (SCT) detector and on the first-level [[calorimeter]] trigger system.

From 1989 to 2001, Charlton worked on the OPAL experiment of the [[Large Electron–Positron Collider]] at CERN, on data analysis, components of the [[Trigger (particle physics)|trigger and data acquisition systems]], and the identification of [[muon]]s.

==Awards and honours==
Charlton was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]] in 2014. His nomination reads: {{centered pull quote|David Charlton is a leader in the experimental elucidation of [[Electroweak interaction|electroweak]] [[symmetry breaking|symmetry-breaking]], culminating in the observation and first characterisation of a [[Higgs boson]], at the [[Large Hadron Collider|LHC]]. His work with the OPAL experiment at the [[Large Electron–Positron Collider|electron-positron collider LEP]] provided the first measurement there of the yield of [[W and Z bosons|Z decays]], then extracted the fraction decaying to [[bottom quark]]s. Later he led the measurements which directly demonstrated the gauge structure of the electroweak sector of the [[Standard Model]]. At the LHC, he led physics preparations in the year before first collisions, acted as [[ATLAS experiment|ATLAS]] Deputy Spokesperson throughout the first three year running period, and is now the collaboration [[spokesperson]].<ref name="royal">{{cite web |url=https://royalsociety.org/people/fellowship/2014/david-charlton/ |title = Professor David Charlton FRS |publisher=The Royal Society |archivedate=2014-07-01 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6Qk2j9KOc |location=London}}</ref>}}
