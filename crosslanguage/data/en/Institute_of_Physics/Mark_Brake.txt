'''Mark Brake''' (born 31 October 1958) is an author. Until 2010 he was a professor of science communication at the [[University of Glamorgan]].<ref>[http://www.markbrake.com/about/ Mark Brake website]</ref>

== Education ==
Brake was born at [[Mountain Ash, Rhondda Cynon Taf|Mountain Ash]], [[Wales]], [[UK]].  He was awarded a BSc by the [[Polytechnic of Wales]] and a MSc by [[University College Cardiff]] in 1988.<ref name=THE>Melanie Newman, [http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=408845&c=1 "Dr? No: Glamorgan scientist falsely claimed PhD"], ''Times Higher Education'', 29 October 2009</ref>

== False PhD Claim ==
Brake submitted a grant application to the Research Councils' Procurement Organisation in 2006 in which he falsely claimed to have a PhD.<ref name=THE/><ref>Sarah Miloudi, [http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2009/10/19/cardiff-scientist-with-nasa-links-falsely-claimed-phd-91466-24960138/ "Cardiff scientist with Nasa links falsely claimed PhD"], ''Western Mail'', 19 October 2009</ref> After 2009, the matter became public knowledge, particularly pressed by Professor [[Peter Coles]] of [[Cardiff University]], but Glamorgan still refused to sack Brake. In 2010 Brake was declared 'redundant' with the minimum of publicity and his employment with the University of Glamorgan was terminated.<ref>{{cite web|last=Coles|first=Peter|title=Brake Out|url=http://telescoper.wordpress.com/2010/04/07/brake-out/|work=In the Dark|accessdate=13 October 2012}}</ref>

== Public Engagement with Science ==
Between 2003 and 2008, Brake was responsible for leading [[public engagement]] initiatives in science, which attracted around £5 million of funding.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://people.glam.ac.uk/view/190/#interests |title=Mark Brake - about |publisher=Univ Glamorgan |date= |accessdate=2009-12-11}}</ref>  The RoCCoTO project, launched in 2001, was a community-based science course for the public, featuring ideas about science and their cultural context in an instance of "Third Culture" studies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/1612268.stm |title=Dome is home to robotic telescope |publisher=BBC News |date=22 October 2001 |accessdate=2009-12-11}}</ref>  The RoCCoTO project received a Public Engagement Award from the [[Astrobiology Society of Britain]] in 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.glam.ac.uk/news/en/2008/jul/04/glamorgan-astronomers-receive-prize-public-engagem/ |title=Glamorgan Astronomers Receive Prize for Public Engagement |publisher=Univ Glamorgan |date=2008-07-14 |accessdate=2009-12-11}}</ref>  [http://alienworlds.glam.ac.uk/ Alien Worlds], an award-winning multimedia website associated with the RoCCoTO project was launched in July 2009.  The website is an animated guide to phenomena such as eclipses of the [http://alienworlds.glam.ac.uk/solarEclipse.html Sun] and [http://alienworlds.glam.ac.uk/lunarEclipse.html Moon], and demonstrates Earth’s place in a cosmic perspective through advanced, animated visuals.

== View on Darwin ==

Brake has stated <ref>{{cite web|url=

|title=Darwin and Wallace inspired by Malthus |publisher=Guardian |date=2009-12-09  |accessdate=2009-12-11}}</ref> 
that [[Charles Darwin]] did not have the version of the theory of evolution described in his 1859 [[Origin of Species]] until after he had become aware of [[Alfred Russel Wallace]]'s theory, published in 1855 and 1856, and in a letter to Darwin in 1857. This view has been contested.<ref>{{cite web|url=
