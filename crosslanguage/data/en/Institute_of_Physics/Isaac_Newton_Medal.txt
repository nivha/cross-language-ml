The '''Isaac Newton Medal''' is a prize awarded annually by the [[Institute of Physics]] and is valued at £1000. The award is given to a physicist, regardless of subject area, background or nationality, for outstanding contributions to physics. The award winner is invited to give a lecture at the Institute.
