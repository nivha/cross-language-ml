Pease's father was the geneticist [[Michael Pease]], son of [[Edward Reynolds Pease]]. His mother was Helen Bowen Wedgwood, daughter of [[Josiah Wedgwood IV]].  He was the great-great-great-great-grandson of the potter [[Josiah Wedgwood]].

During WWII he joined [[RAF Bomber Command]]'s [[Operational Research]] section, where he was the expert in charge of the use of a precision navigation system called [[G-H (navigation)|G-H]]. Field-based, he advised on operational techniques to use the equipment most effectively. Notably, he helped [[No. 218 Squadron RAF]] in [[Operation Glimmer]], a diversionary "attack" on [[Normandy Landings|D-Day]] that distracted and pinned-down German defences while the real attack occurring 200 miles to the west. His G-H-equipped bombers flew low, in tight circles, dropping [[Chaff (countermeasure)|window]] over radar transponder-equipped small ships, in order to deceive the German radars that they were the main invasion fleet.<ref>[http://www.technologyreview.com/computing/17847/page3/ A Failure of Intelligence] Bomber Command OR by Freeman Dyson</ref>

After the war he was director of the [[Joint European Torus|Culham Laboratory for Plasma Physics and Nuclear Fusion]] (1968–1981) and head of the British chapter of [[Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs|Pugwash]] (1988–2002).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pugwash.org/uk/documents/SEBASTIAN%20PEASEObit17.10.04.pdf |title=SEBASTIAN PEASE OBITUARY
