==Biography==

===Youth and education===
Abdus Salam was born on 29 January 1926 in Santokdas in the [[Sahiwal District]] (but grew up in [[Jhang]]), to Chaudhry Muhammad Hussain and Hajira Hussain, into a [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] family which converted to Islam in the 12th century and had a long tradition of piety and passion for learning (his own grandfather, Gul Muhammad, was a religious scholar apart from being a physician).<ref name="kibble98"/> Salam's father was an education officer in the Department of Education of [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab State]] in a poor farming district.

At age 14, Salam scored the highest marks ever recorded for the matriculation examination at the [[University of the Punjab|Punjab University]].<ref>{{harv|Fraser|2008|pp=59–78}}</ref> He won a full scholarship to the [[Government College, Lahore|Government College University]] of [[Lahore]], [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab State]].<ref>{{harv|Fraser|2008|pp=78–80}}</ref> Salam was a versatile scholar, interested in [[Urdu literature|Urdu]] and [[British literature|English literature]] in which he excelled.<ref>{{harv|Murthi|1999|pp=42}}</ref> But he soon picked up Mathematics as his concentration.<ref>{{harv|Murthi|1999|pp=43}}</ref> Salam's mentor and tutors wanted him to become an English teacher, but Salam decided to stick with Mathematics<ref name="Munir Ahmad Khan, Former Chairman of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, former Head of the Nuclear Engineering Division, and former Head of the Reactor Engineering IAEA Division ">{{cite journal

===Academic career===

After his doctorate in 1951, Salam returned to the [[Government College University, Lahore|Government College University]] as a Professor of Mathematics where he remained till 1954. During the same period, he was the Chairman of the Department of Mathematics, and professor as well, at the University of the Punjab. As he became the chairman, Salam sought to update the university curriculum, making a course of [[Quantum mechanics]] as a part of undergraduate course.<ref>{{harv|Fayyazuddin|2005|pp=5}}</ref>  This was soon reverted by the Vice-Chancellor, and Salam decided to teach an evening course in Quantum Mechanics outside the regular curriculum.<ref>{{harv|Fayyazuddin|2005|pp=5–6}}</ref>  While Salam had mixed popularity in the university, he began to supervise the education of students who were particularly influenced by him.<ref>{{harv|Fayyazuddin|2005|pp=7–8}}</ref> As a result, [[Riazuddin (physicist)|Riazuddin]] remained the only student of Salam who has the privilege to study under Salam at the under-graduate and post-graduate level in Lahore, and [[Postdoctoral research|Post-doctoral]] level in Cambridge University. In 1953, Salam was unable to establish a research institute in Lahore, as he faced strong opposition from his peers.<ref>{{harv|Fraser|2008|pp=237–238}}</ref> In 1954, Salam took fellowship and became one of the earliest [[Fellow of the Pakistan Academy of Sciences|fellows of the Pakistan Academy of Sciences]]. As a result of [[1953 Lahore riots]], Salam went back to Cambridge and joined [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's College]], and took a position as a professor of mathematics in 1954.<ref>{{harv|Duff|2007|pp=39–41}}</ref>
In 1957, he was invited to take a chair at [[Imperial College, London]], and he and [[Paul Taunton Matthews|Paul Matthews]] went on to set up the Theoretical Physics Department at Imperial College.<ref>{{harv|Duff|2007|pp=ix}}</ref>  As time passed, this department became one of the prestigious research departments that included well known physicists such as [[Steven Weinberg]], [[Tom W. B. Kibble|Tom Kibble]], [[Gerald Guralnik]], [[C. R. Hagen]], Riazuddin, and [[John Clive Ward|John Ward]].

In 1957,  Punjab University conferred Salam with an [[Honorary degree|Honorary doctorate]] for his contribution in Particle physics.<ref>{{harv|Duff|2007|pp=37}}</ref> The same year with help from his mentor, Salam launched a scholarship programme for his students in Pakistan. Salam retained strong links with Pakistan, and visited his country from time to time.<ref>{{harv|Duff|2007|pp=iix}}</ref> At Cambridge and Imperial College he formed a group of theoretical physicists, the majority of whom were his Pakistani students.

In 1959, he became one of the youngest to be named [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] at the age of 33.<ref name="kibble98"/> Salam took a fellowship at the [[Princeton University]] in 1959, where he met with [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]]<ref>{{harv|Fraser|2008|pp=239–240}}</ref> and to whom he presented his research work on neutrinos.<ref>{{harv|Fraser|2008|pp=241–242}}</ref> Oppenheimer and Salam discussed the foundation of electrodynamics, problems and their solution.<ref>{{harv|Fraser|2008|pp=250}}</ref> His dedicated personal assistant was Jean Bouckley.

===Scientific career===
[[File:Abdus Salam lecture.jpg|thumb|right|Abdus Salam lectures on G.U.T. at the University of Chicago's Oriental Institute]]
Early in his career, Salam made an important and significant contribution in [[quantum electrodynamics]] and [[quantum field theory]], including its extension into [[Particle physics|particle]] and [[nuclear physics]]. In his early career in Pakistan, Salam was greatly interested in mathematical series and their relation to physics. Salam had played an influential role in the advancement of nuclear physics, but he maintained and dedicated himself to mathematics and theoretical physics and focused Pakistan to do more research in theoretical physics.<ref name="Munir Ahmad Khan, Former Chairman of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, former Head of the Nuclear Engineering Division, and former Head of the Reactor Engineering IAEA Division"/> However, he regarded nuclear physics (nuclear fission and nuclear power) as a non-pioneering part of physics as it had already "happened".<ref name="Munir Ahmad Khan, Former Chairman of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, former Head of the Nuclear Engineering Division, and former Head of the Reactor Engineering IAEA Division "/> Even in Pakistan, Salam was the leading driving force in theoretical physics in Pakistan, with many scientists he continued to influence and encourage to keep their work on theoretical physics.<ref name="Munir Ahmad Khan, Former Chairman of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, former Head of the Nuclear Engineering Division, and former Head of the Reactor Engineering IAEA Division "/>

Salam had a prolific research career in theoretical and high-energy physics.<ref name="Riazuddin 2005 31">{{harv|Riazuddin|2005|pp=31}}</ref> Salam had worked on theory of the [[neutrino]] — an elusive particle that was first postulated by [[Wolfgang Pauli]] in 1930s. Salam introduced [[chiral symmetry]] in the theory of neutrinos. The introduction of chiral symmetry played crucial role in subsequent development of the [[Electroweak interaction|theory of electroweak interactions]].<ref>{{harv|Riazuddin|2005|pp=31–33}}</ref> Salam later passed his work to [[Riazuddin (physicist)|Riazuddin]], who made pioneering contributions in neutrinos.  Salam introduced the massive [[Higgs boson]]s to the theory of the [[Standard Model]], where he later predicted the existence of [[proton decay]]. In 1963, Salam published his theoretical work on the [[vector meson]]. The paper introduced the interaction of vector meson, photon (vector [[electrodynamics]]), and the [[renormalization]] of vector mesons' known mass after the interaction.<ref>{{harv|Riazuddin|1994|pp=124–127}}</ref> In 1961, Salam began to work with [[John Clive Ward]] on [[Symmetry (physics)|symmetries]] and [[Electroweak unification]].<ref>{{cite doi|10.1007/BF02812723}}</ref><ref>{{cite doi|10.1016/0031-9163(64)90711-5}}</ref> In 1964, Salam and Ward worked on a [[Gauge theory]] for the [[Weak interaction|weak]] and [[electromagnetic interaction]], subsequently obtaining [[Special unitary group|SU(2)]] × [[Circle group|U(1)]] model. Salam was convinced that all the [[Fundamental interaction|elementary particle]] interactions are actually the Gauge interactions.<ref name="uddin 1994 149–157">{{harv|Riazuddin|1994|pp=149–157}}</ref> In 1968, together with [[Steven Weinberg|Weinberg]] and [[Sheldon Glashow]], Salam formulated the mathematical concept of their work. While in Imperial College, Salam, along with Glashow and [[Jeffrey Goldstone]], mathematically proved the [[Goldstone boson|Goldstone's theorem]], that a massless [[Spin (physics)|spin-zero]] object must appear in a theory as a result of spontaneous breaking of a continuous [[global symmetry]].<ref name="uddin 1994 149–157"/> In 1960, Salam and Weinberg incorporated the [[Higgs mechanism]] into Glashow's discovery, giving a it a modern form in electroweak theory, and thus theorised the Standard Model.<ref>{{cite conference |author=Salam, A.  |editor=N. Svartholm |year=1968 |booktitle=Elementary Particle Physics: Relativistic Groups and Analyticity |pages=367 |conference=Eighth Nobel Symposium |publisher=Almquvist and Wiksell |location=Stockholm}}</ref> In 1968, together with [[Steven Weinberg|Weinberg]] and [[Sheldon Glashow]], Salam finally formulated the mathematical concept of their work.

In 1966, Salam carried out pioneering work on a [[hypothetical particle]]. Salam showed the possible [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] interaction between the [[Magnetic monopole]] and the [[CP-violation|C-violation]], thus he formulated the [[magnetic photon]].<ref name="A. Salam 1966 683–684">{{cite journal | author=Salam, A. | title= Magnetic monopole and two photon theories of C-violation | journal=Physics Letters | volume=22 | year=1966 | issue=5 | pages= 683–684 | doi= 10.1016/0031-9163(66)90704-9|bibcode = 1966PhL....22..683S }}</ref>

Following the publication of [[1964 PRL symmetry breaking papers|PRL Symmetry Breaking]] papers in 1964, Steven Weinberg and Salam were the first to apply the Higgs mechanism to [[electroweak symmetry breaking]]. Salam provided a mathematical postulation for the interaction between the Higgs boson and the electroweak symmetry theory.<ref>{{harv|Riazuddin|1994|pp=156–158}}</ref>

In 1972, Salam began to work with [[Indian-American]] theoretical physicist [[Jogesh Pati]]. Pati wrote to Salam several times expressing interest to work under Salam's direction, in response to which Salam eventually invited Pati to the ICTP seminar in Pakistan. Salam suggested to Pati that there should be some deep reason why the protons and electrons are so different and yet carry equal but opposite electric charge. Protons carry quarks, but the electroweak theory was concerned only with the electrons and neutrinos, with nothing postulated about quarks. If all of nature's ingredients could be brought together in one new symmetry, it might reveal a reason for the various features of these particles and the forces they feel. This led to the development of [[Pati–Salam model]] in particle physics.<ref>{{harv|Fraser|2008|pp=205}}</ref> In 1973, Salam and Jogesh Pati were the first to notice that since [[Quark]]s and [[Lepton]]s have very similar [[Special unitary group|SU(2)]] </sub>× [[Circle group|U(1)]] representation content, they all may have similar entities.<ref>{{harv|Riazuddin|1994|pp=321–322}}</ref> They provided a simple realisation of the quark-lepton symmetry by postulating that [[lepton number]] was a fourth [[Color charge|colour]], dubbed "violet".<ref>{{harv|Riazuddin|1994|pp=322}}</ref>

Physicists had believed that there were four fundamental forces of nature: the gravitational force, the strong and weak nuclear forces, and the electromagnetic force. Salam had worked on the unification of these forces from 1959 with Glashow and Weinberg.  While at Imperial College London, Salam successfully showed that weak nuclear forces are not really different from electromagnetic forces, and two could inter-convert. Salam provided a theory that shows the unification of two fundamental forces of nature, weak nuclear forces and the electromagnetic forces, one into another.<ref name="Riazuddin 2005 31"/> Glashow had also formulated the same work, and the theory was combined in 1966. In 1967, Salam proved the electroweak unification theory mathematically, and finally published the papers. For this achievement, Salam, Glashow, and Weinberg were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1979. The Nobel Prize Foundation paid tribute to the scientists and issued a statement saying: "For their contributions to the theory of the unified weak and electromagnetic interaction between elementary particles, including, inter alia, the prediction of the weak neutral current".<ref name="Nobel Prize"/>  In the 1970s Salam continued trying to unify forces by including the strong interaction in a [[grand unified theory]].

[[File:routeabdussalam.png|thumb|right|The road named after Abdus Salam in [[CERN]], Geneva]]
Abdus Salam immediately returned to Pakistan in 1960 to take charge of a government post that was given to him by President [[Field Marshal Ayub Khan]]. From her [[Creation of Pakistan|independence]], Pakistan has never had a coherent [[Science in Pakistan|Science policy]], and the total expenditure on research and development represent ~1.0% of Pakistan's GDP.<ref>{{harv|Ghani|1982|pp=64–83}}</ref> Even the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) headquarters was located in a small room, and less than 10 scientists were working on a fundamental concepts of physics.<ref>{{harv|Ghani|1982|pp=67–70}}</ref> Abdus Salam replaced [[Salimuzzaman Siddiqui]] as [[Ministry of Science and Technology (Pakistan)#Science Advisors|Science Advisor]], became first [[Chief technical officer|Member (technical)]] of Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission. Abdus Salam expanded the web of physics research and development in Pakistan by sending more than 500 scientists abroad.<ref>[[Ishfaq Ahmad]], Abdus Salam was responsible for sending more than 500 scientists to thr United States</ref> In September 1961, Abdus Salam approached President Ayub Khan to set up the country's first national space agency.<ref name="Suparco">{{cite news|url=http://www.suparco.gov.pk/pages/history.asp| work=Suparco | title=Suparco's History }}</ref>  On 16 September 1961, through an executive order, [[Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission]] was established, in which Abdus Salam served as the first director.<ref name="Suparco"/> Before 1960, very little work on scientific development was done, and scientific activities in Pakistan were almost diminished. Abdus Salam called [[Ishfaq Ahmad]], a nuclear physicist, who had left the country for Switzerland where he joined CERN, to Pakistan. With the support of Abdus Salam, PAEC established PAEC Lahore Center-6, with Ishfaq Ahmad as its first director.<ref>{{harv|Rahman|1998|pp=11–12}}</ref> In 1967, Abdus Salam became a central and administrative figure to lead the research in both Theoretical and Particle physics.<ref name="CERN Courier"/> With the establishment of Institute of Physics at [[Quaid-e-Azam University]], the research in theoretical and particle physics was engaged.<ref name="CERN Courier"/> Under Abdus Salam's direction, physicists tackled the greatest outstanding problems in physics and mathematics.<ref name="CERN Courier"/> Another physicist, [[Raziuddin Siddiqui]], established numerous physics research group and supervised research activities in the academic institutions of Pakistan.<ref name="ICTP"/> Under the direction of Abdus Salam, research in physics reached a point that prompted worldwide recognition of Pakistani physicists.<ref name="ICTP"/>

From 1950s, Abdus Salam had tirelessly tried establishing high-powered research institutes in Pakistan, though he was unable to do so. Abdus Salam moved PAEC Headquarters to a bigger building, and established research laboratories all over the country.<ref>{{harv|Rahman|1998|pp=05–19}}</ref> On the direction of Abdus Salam, [[Ishrat Hussain Usmani]] set up plutonium and uranium exploration committees throughout the country. In October 1961, Abdus Salam travelled to the United States and signed a space-cooperation agreement between Pakistan and United States. on November 1961, NASA started to build a space facility — [[Sonmiani (space facility)|Flight Test Range]] — in Balochistan where Abdus Salam served as its first technical director.

Abdus Salam played an influential and significant role in Pakistan's development in nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. In 1964, Abdus Salam was made head of Pakistan's IAEA delegation and represented Pakistan for a decade.<ref>{{harv|Duff|2007|pp=18–19}}</ref> The same year, Abdus Salam joined [[Munir Ahmad Khan]] — Abdus Salam's lifelong friend and contemporary at Government College University. Khan was the first person in the IAEA that Abdus Salam had consulted about the establishment of [[International Centre for Theoretical Physics]], a research physics institution, in [[Trieste]], Italy. With an agreement signed with IAEA, the International Centre for Theoretical Physics was set up with Abdus Salam as its first director. At IAEA, Abdus Salam had tirelessly advocated the importance of nuclear power plants in his country.<ref>{{harv|Duff|2007|pp=19–20}}</ref> It was due to his effort that in 1965, Canada and Pakistan signed a nuclear energy cooperation deal. Salam had obtained the permission from Ayub Khan – against the wishes of Ayub Khan's own government functionaries – to set up the [[Karachi Nuclear Power Plant|nuclear power plant]] near Karachi.<ref>{{harv|Riazuddin|2005|pp=33–34}}</ref> In 1965, with the efforts led by Abdus Salam, the United States and Pakistan signed an agreement in which th U.S. provided Pakistan with a small [[Pakistan Atomic Research Reactor#PARR-I Reactor|research reactor]]. Abdus Salam had a long dream to establish a research institute in Pakistan, for which he had advocated on many different occasions. In 1965, Abdus Salam and [[Edward Durrell Stone]] signed a contract for the establishment of [[Pakistan Institute of Nuclear Science and Technology]] at [[Nilore]], Islamabad.<ref>{{harv|Rahman|1998|pp=30–31}}</ref>

===Space programme===
{{Main|Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission}}
Salam was the founder of Pakistan's space programme as he was responsible for the establishment of the [[space research]] activities in Pakistan. In early 1961, Salam approached President Ayub Khan to lay the foundation of country's first executive agency to coordinate space research.<ref name="Suparco"/> On 16 September 1961, through an executive order, the [[Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission]] (SUPARCO) was established of which Salam was made its first and founder director of the agency.<ref name="Suparco"/> Salam immediately travelled to United States, where he successfully signed a space cooperation agreement with United States Government. In November 1961, NASA built [[Sonmiani (space facility)|Flight Test Center]] (FTC) in [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan Province]]. During this time, Salam visited [[Pakistan Air Force Academy|Air Force Academy]] where he met with [[Air Commodore]] ([[Brigadier-General]]) [[Wladyslaw Turowicz]] — a Polish military scientist and an [[aerospace engineer]].<ref>{{harv|Duff|2007|pp=50–60}}</ref> Turowicz was made the first technical director of the space center, and a programme of rocket testing of insued. In 1964, while in the United States, Salam visited the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]], and met with nuclear engineers [[Salim Mehmud]] and [[Tariq Mustafa]].<ref name="CNBC Pakistan">{{cite news|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20110622100656/http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3927488686022979715#| work=CNBC | title=Abdus Salam's footprint in Pakistan's Space Programme |date= 13 May 2007|author=Mehmud, Salim }}</ref> Salam signed another agreement with [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) in which NASA launched a programme to provide training to Pakistan's scientists and engineers.<ref name="CNBC Pakistan"/> Both nuclear engineers returned to Pakistan in few months and were inducted in Suparco.<ref name="Suparco"/>

===Nuclear weapons programme===

Salam knew the importance of [[nuclear technology]] in Pakistan, for the civilian and peaceful purposes.<ref name="Pakistan Defence Journal"/> But, according to his biographers, Salam played an ambiguous role in Pakistan's own integrated atomic bomb project. As late as in 1960s, Salam made an unsuccessful attempt for a proposal for the establishment of nuclear fuel reprocessing plant, but it was deferred the matter on economic grounds by Ayub Khan.<ref name="Pakistan Defence Journal">{{cite journal|last=Shabbir|first=Usman|author2=Syed Ahmed|author3=H Khan|title=Pakistan’s Nuclear Journey – from Multan to Chaghi: Development and testing of nuclear weapons|journal=Pakistan Defence Journal|date=May 2007|volume=1|issue=2|pages=42–56|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070221190710/http://www.pakdef.info/ereporter/PakDef%20Mag%20Vol%201%20Issue%202.pdf|accessdate=12 October 2012}}</ref> According to Rehman, Salam's influence in the nuclear development was lessened and diminished as late as 1974, and became critical of Bhutto's control over the science.<ref name="Pakistan Defence Journal"/> But Salam personally did not terminate his connection with the scientists working in the Theoretical physics division at PAEC.<ref name="Rahman 1998 15–19">{{harv|Rahman|1998|pp=15–19}}</ref> As early as 1972–73, he had been a great advocate for the atomic bomb project,<ref name="Norman Dombey, Physics and Astronomy Department of the University of Sussex"/> but subsequently took the stance against it after he fell out with Bhutto over the issue of [[Second Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan|Ahmaddiya denomination as non-Islamic]].<ref name="Norman Dombey, Physics and Astronomy Department of the University of Sussex">{{cite web|last=Dombey|first=Norman|title=Salam’s Part in the Pakistan's atomic bomb projects|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:nEoPfxzPkNEJ:arxiv.org/pdf/1112.2266+Munir+Khan+nuclear+physics&hl=en&gl=us&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEEShQmDsuYoVt0GT8axNM0X0pjNXkMe3AGotfelN95mdjDAF3NmyIY7FX38mbDXfrxtQUeby8RWbmdxnJYTIGwUFF8ExKjEbUNmzhWb0qJlPfE25kYXhAjjs8KX4ZPYj4hCoqAbK5&sig=AHIEtbScOMeOEw-JdPP4eX2pZLyOg9LDng|publisher=Physics and Astronomy Department of the University of Sussex|accessdate=30 October 2012|location=Brighton BN1 9QH|format=google docs|date=10 December 2011}}</ref>

In 1965, Salam led the establishing of the nuclear research institute—[[Pakistan Institute of Nuclear Science and Technology]].<ref>{{harv|Rahman|1998|pp=09–10}}</ref> In 1965, the plutonium reactor [[Pakistan Atomic Research Reactor]] went [[Critical mass|critical]] under the leadership of Salam.<ref name="Rahman 1998 15–19"/> In 1973, Salam proposed the idea of establishing the annual college in order to promote the scientific activities in the country to the Chairman of PAEC, [[Munir Ahmad Khan]], who wholeheartedly accepted and fully supported this idea. This led to the establishment of the [[International Nathiagali Summer College on Physics and Contemporary Needs]] (INSC), where each year since 1976 scientists from all over the world come to Pakistan to interact with Pakistani scientists. The first annual INSC conference was held on advanced particle and nuclear physics.

In November 1971, Salam met with [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] in his residence, and according to Bhutto's advice, Salam went to United States to evade the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|1971 Indo-Pak winter war]].<ref>{{harv|Rahman|1998|pp=25–40}}</ref> In 1971, Salam had travelled to the United States and returned to Pakistan with scientific literature about the [[Manhattan Project]],<ref>{{harv|Rahman|1998|pp=38–40}}</ref> and calculations involving in the atomic bombs.<ref name="Norman Dombey, Physics and Astronomy Department of the University of Sussex"/> In 1972, the Government of Pakistan learned about the development status of the first atomic bomb completed under the [[Indian nuclear programme]]. In 20 January 1972, at the Multan meeting, Bhutto orchestrated to develop the deterrence programme.<ref>{{harv|Rahman|1998|pp=3–9}}</ref>  Former Prime minister, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, formed a group of scientists and engineers, which was first headed by Salam.<ref>{{harv|Rahman|1998|pp=38–89}}</ref> In 1972, Salam, as [[Science Advisor|Science advisor]] to the [[President of Pakistan|President]], had managed and participated in a secret meeting of nuclear scientists with Bhutto in [[Multan]], which came to be known as the "''Multan Meeting''". At this meeting, only [[Ishrat Hussain Usmani|I.H. Usmani]] protested whose believed was that the country had no facilities nor talent to carry out such ambitious and technologically giant project at that time, whilst Salam remained quiet<ref name="Lancers Publications, U.S."/> Here, Bhutto entrusted Salam and appointed Munir Ahmad Khan as Chairman of the PAEC and head of the atomic bomb program, as Salam had supported Khan.<ref>{{Cite book

An office was set up for Salam in the [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime ministers' Secretariat]] by order of Bhutto.<ref name="Pakistan Defence Journal"/> Salam immediately started to motivate and gravitate scientists to begin work with PAEC in the development of fission weapons.<ref name="Pakistan Defence Journal"/> In December 1972, two [[theoretical physicist]]s working at the [[International Centre for Theoretical Physics]] were asked by Salam to report to [[Munir Ahmad Khan]], the scientific director of the program.<ref>{{harv|Rahman|1998|pp=37–38}}</ref> This marked the beginning of the "Theoretical Physics Group (TPG)", reporting directly to Salam.<ref>{{harv|Rahman|1998|pp=38}}</ref> The TPG, in PAEC, was assigned to conduct research in [[fast neutron calculations]], [[hydrodynamics]] (how the explosion produced by a chain reaction might behave), problems of neutron diffusion, and the development of theoretical designs of Pakistan's nuclear weapon devices.<ref>{{harv|Rahman|1998|pp=39–41}}</ref> Later, the Theoretical Physics Group working under the leadership of [[Riazuddin (physicist)|Riazuddin]], who was also Salam's student, began to directly report to Salam, and the work on the theoretical design of the nuclear weapon device was completed in 1977.<ref>{{harv|Rahman|1998|pp=39}}</ref> Hence, Salam had led the groundbreaking work in the development of the weapons programme, with Khan. In 1972, Salam had formed the Mathematical Physics Group, under [[Raziuddin Siddiqui]], that was charged, with the Theoretical Physics Group, to carry out the research in the theory of [[Relativity of simultaneity|simultaneity]] during the detonation process, and mathematics involved in the theory of nuclear fission<ref>{{harv|Rahman|1998|pp=45–49}}</ref> Following the India's surprise [[nuclear test]] —[[Pokhran-I]] — in 1974, [[Munir Ahmad Khan]] had called for a meeting to initiate the work on atomic bomb, which was attended by Salam and where [[Muhammad Hafeez Qureshi]] was appointed head of the Directorate of Technical Development in PAEC.<ref>{{harv|Rahman|1998|pp=22–41}}</ref>

The DTD was set up to coordinate the work of the various specialized groups of scientists and engineers working on different aspects of the atomic bomb.<ref name="Rahman 1998 55–59"/> The word "[[Atomic bomb|bomb]]" was never used in this meeting, but the participants fully understood what was being discussed.<ref name="Rahman 1998 55–59"/> On March 1974, Salam and Khan also established the Wah Group Scientist that was charged with the manufacturing materials, explosive lenses and [[Nuclear weapon design|triggering mechanism]] development of the weapon.<ref>{{harv|Rahman|1998|pp=40–41}}</ref> Following the setting up of DTD, Salam, along with Riazuddin and [[Munir Ahmad Khan]], visited the [[Pakistan Ordnance Factories]] (POF) where they held talks and discussions with senior military engineers led by POF Chairman [[Lieutenant-General]] Qamar Ali Mirza.<ref name="Rahman 1998 75–76"/> It was there that the [[Corps of Engineers, Pakistan Army|Corps of Engineers]] built the [[Metallurgical Laboratory]] in [[Wah Cantonment|Wah Cantt]] in 1976.<ref>{{harv|Rahman|1998|pp=25–26}}</ref> Thus, the Wah Group working under the DTD was charged with the material and [[Nuclear weapon design|triggering mechanism]] development of the weapon.<ref>{{harv|Rahman|1998|pp=41–22}}</ref> Salam remained associated with the nuclear weapons programme until the mid-1974, when he left the country after [[Ahmadis]] were declared non-Muslims by the Pakistani Parliament.<ref>{{harv|Rahman|1998|pp=101}}</ref> His own relations with Prime minister Bhutto fell out and turned into open hostility after the Ahmadi community domination was declared as not-Islamic; he lodge a public and powerful protest against Prime minister Bhutto regarding this issue and gave great criticism to Bhutto over his control over the science.<ref name="Norman Dombey, Physics and Astronomy Department of the University of Sussex"/> In spite of this, Salam maintained close relations with the theoretical physics division at PAEC who kept him informed about the every status of the calculations needed to calculate the performance of the atomic bomb, according to Norman Dombey.<ref name="Norman Dombey, Physics and Astronomy Department of the University of Sussex"/> After seeing the Indian [[Siachen conflict|aggression]] in [[Northern Pakistan]], followed by [[Operation Brasstacks|massive troops rotation]] in [[Sindh|Southern Pakistan]], Salam again renewed his ties with the senior scientists working in the atomic bomb projects, including [[Ishfaq Ahmad]] and others, who had kept him inform about the scientific development of the program.<ref name="Norman Dombey, Physics and Astronomy Department of the University of Sussex"/> In 1980s, Salam personally approved many appointments and large influx of Pakistani scientists associateship program at [[ICTP]] and [[CERN]], and engage in research with his students in theoretical physics with his students at the ICTP.<ref name="Norman Dombey, Physics and Astronomy Department of the University of Sussex"/>

In 2008, Indian scholar Ravi Singh also noted in his book that "in 1978, Abdus Salam with PAEC officials, paid a secret visit to China, and was an instrumental initiating the industrial nuclear cooperation between the two countries."<ref name="Lancers Publications, U.S.">{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Ravi Shekhar Narain|title=The Military Factor in Pakistan|year=2008|publisher=Lancers Publications, U.S.|location=United States|isbn=978-0-9815378-9-4|pages=403–404|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=wCm2DFZblOYC&pg=PA404}}</ref>  Although, he had left the country, Salam did not hesitate to advise the PAEC and Theoretical and Mathematical Physics Group on important scientific matters, and kept his close association with TPG and PAEC.<ref>{{harv|Riazuddin|2005|pp=32}}</ref>

==Advocacy for science==

In 1964, Salam founded the [[International Centre for Theoretical Physics]] (ICTP), [[Trieste]], in the North-East of Italy and served as its director until 1993.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ictp.it/ |title=The Ictp |publisher=Ictp.it |date=3 December 2012 |accessdate=9 December 2012}}</ref> In 1974, he founded [[International Nathiagali Summer College on Physics and Contemporary Needs|International Nathiagali Summer College]] (INSC) to promote science in his country.<ref name="INSC">{{cite news|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20071002154826/http://www.ncp.edu.pk/insc/index.htm | work=INSC| title=International Nathiagali Summer College}}</ref> The INSC is an annual meeting of scientists from all over the world to come to Pakistan and hold discussions on different aspects of physics and science.<ref name="INSC"/> Even today, the INSC holds an annual meetings, and Salam's pupil student Riazuddin is its director since its inception.<ref>{{cite web| title =Organizers of INSC|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070612082445/http://www.ncp.edu.pk/insc/organizers.htm|accessdate =12 March 2011}}</ref>

In 1997, the scientists at ICPT commemorated Salam and renamed ICTP as "'''[[Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics]]'''". Salam had advocated for development of Science in third world countries, and attended various seminars in different countries. Throughout the years, Salam served on a number of United Nations committees concerning science and technology in developing countries.<ref name="NobelBio" /> Salam also founded the [[Third World Academy of Sciences]] (TWAS) and was a leading figure in the creation of a number of international centres dedicated to the advancement of science and technology.<ref>{{cite web|title =Third World Academy of Sciences|url=http://www.twas.org/|accessdate =12 March 2011| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110425060340/http://www.twas.org/| archivedate= 25 April 2011| deadurl=no}}</ref>

During his visit at the Institute of Physics of [[Quaid-i-Azam University]] in 1979, Salam had explained after receiving his award: ''Physicists believed there are four fundamental forces of nature; the gravitational force, the weak and strong nuclear force, and the electromagnetic force''.<ref name="Riazuddin 2005 34">{{harv|Riazuddin|2005|pp=34}}</ref> Salam was a firm believer that "scientific thought is the common heritage of mankind", and that developing nations needed to help themselves and invest in their own scientists to boost development and reduce the gap between the [[North–South divide|Global South and the Global North]], thus contributing to a more peaceful world.<ref>{{cite web

Although Salam had departed from Pakistan, he did not terminate his connection to Pakistan.<ref>{{harv|Riazuddin|2005|pp=31–32}}</ref> Salam continued inviting Pakistan's scientists to ICTP, and maintained a research programme for the Pakistani scientists.<ref>{{harv|Fraser|2008|pp=300–301}}</ref> Many prominent scientists, including [[Ghulam Murtaza (physicist)|Ghulam Murtaza]],  [[Riazuddin (physicist)|Riazuddin]], [[Kamaluddin Ahmed]], [[Faheem Hussain]], [[Raziuddin Siddiqui]], [[Munir Ahmad Khan]], [[Ishfaq Ahmad]], and [[I. H. Usmani]], considered him as their mentor and a teacher.

==Personal life==
Salam was a very private individual, who kept his public and personal lives quite separate.<ref name="kibble98"/> He married twice, and at his death, was survived by three daughters and a son by his first wife, and a son and daughter by his second, Professor [[Louise Johnson|Dame Louise Johnson]], formerly Professor of [[Molecular biophysics|Molecular Biophysics]] in [[Oxford University]]. He married Johnson in 1968 in London.

===Religion===
Salam was "known to be a devout Muslim",<ref name="NobelBio" /> and was a member of the [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]] who saw his religion as fundamental part of his scientific work. He once wrote:<blockquote>"The Holy Qur'an enjoins us to reflect on the verities of Allah's created laws of nature; however, that our generation has been privileged to glimpse a part of His design is a bounty and a grace for which I render thanks with a humble heart."''<ref name="NobelBio" /></blockquote>

During his acceptance speech for the Nobel Prize in Physics, Salam quoted the following verses from the [[Quran]]:
{{quotation|Thou seest not, in the creation of the All-merciful any imperfection, Return thy gaze, seest thou any fissure? Then Return thy gaze, again and again. Thy gaze, Comes back to thee dazzled, aweary.}}

He then said:
{{quotation|This, in effect, is the faith of all physicists; the deeper we seek, the more is our wonder excited, the more is the dazzlement for our gaze.<ref name="The Nobel Prize in Physics 1979 - Banquet Speech">{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1979/salam-speech.html |title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1979 – Banquet Speech |publisher=Nobelprize.org |date=10 December 1979 |accessdate=9 December 2012}}</ref>}}

In 1974, the Pakistan parliament made a [[Second Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan|constitutional amendment]] that declared Ahmadis as non-Muslims. In protest, Salam left Pakistan for London. Even after his departure, Salam did not completely terminate his connection to Pakistan, and kept his close association with the Theoretical Physics Group as well as academic scientists from Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC).<ref name="Riazuddin 2005 34"/> Leaving Pakistan in protest was one of Salam's greatest regrets.<ref>{{harv|Fraser|2008|pp=303–304}}</ref>{{dubious|date=July 2014}} At ICTP, Salam had launched series of post-research programmes for Pakistani academics with whom he had developed extremely close relations. In 1983, Riazuddin and [[Asghar Qadir]] returned to ICTP where they had joined Salam, and stayed with him until 1990.<ref name="Chowk.com"/>

===Death===
[[File:Grave of Abdus Salam.jpg|thumb|right|The defaced grave of Abdus Salam at Rabwah, Punjab]]

<blockquote>"When Dr. Salam was to deliver a lecture, the hall would be packed and although the subject was [[Particle Physics]], his manner and eloquence was such as if he was talking about literature. When he finished his lectures, listeners would often burst into spontaneous applause and give him a standing ovation. People from all parts of the world would come to [[Imperial College]] and seek Dr. Salam's help. He would give a patient hearing to everyone including those who were talking nonsense. He treated everyone with respect and compassion and never belittled or offended anyone. Dr. Salam's strength was that he could "sift jewels from the sand"".<ref name="chowkbio">Zainab Mahmood (November 26, 2004) {{Wayback |date=20080216051624 |url=http://www.chowk.com/articles/8387 |title=Dr Abdus Salam – The ’Mystic’ scientist }}. Chowk: Science</ref></blockquote>

[[Ishfaq Ahmad]], former chairman of the PAEC and a lifelong friend of Salam recalls:

<blockquote>"Dr Salam was responsible for sending about 500 physicists, mathematicians and scientists from Pakistan, for PhD's to the best institutions in UK and USA".<ref name="chowkbio"/></blockquote>

In August 1996, the former chairman of PAEC and lifelong friend, [[Munir Ahmad Khan]] and met Salam in Oxford. Munir Ahmad Khan (late), who headed the [[Pakistan and Nuclear Weapons|nuclear weapons]] and [[Nuclear energy in Pakistan|energy programme]], said:

<blockquote>"My last meeting with Abdus Salam was only three months ago. His disease had taken its toll and he was unable to talk. Yet he understood what was said. I told him about the celebration held in Pakistan on his seventieth birthday. He kept staring at me. He had risen above praise. As I rose to leave he pressed my hand to express his feelings as if he wanted to thank everyone who had said kind words about him. Dr. Abdus Salam had deep love for Pakistan in spite of the fact that he was treated unfairly and indifferently by his own country. It became more and more difficult for him to come to Pakistan and this hurt him deeply. Now he has returned home finally, to rest in peace for ever in the soil that he loved so much. May be in the years to come we will rise above our prejudice and own him and give him, after his death, what we could not when he was alive. We [[Pakistanis]] may choose to ignore Dr. Salam, but the world at large will always remember him."<ref name="chowkbio"/> </blockquote>
