'''Ronald Ernest Aitchison''' (1921–1996), was born in [[Hurstville]], [[NSW]], [[Australia]] on 29 December 1921. From 1942 to 1945 Ron worked as an engineer with the [[Amalgamated Wireless Australasia Limited|Amalgamated Wireless Valve Company]] on the design and production of [[klystron]]s and [[radar]] [[magnetron]]s, which were new devices important to the war effort. He was also involved in work on [[semiconductor]] [[diode]]s, which were the forerunners of the revolution in electronics brought about by the advent of solid-state semiconductor components. In 1945 he joined the [[National Acoustic Laboratories]] where he worked on the design and construction of hearing aids for children.

Aitchison was appointed as Senior Lecturer in Communications Engineering at the [[University of Sydney]], which was the start of his 25-year teaching experience at that institution, culminating in his appointment as Associate Professor. His interest in [[solid-state physics]] took him to [[Bristol University]], [[UK]], for a year and he also spent a year at [[Stanford University]], [[California]], on a [[Fulbright scholarship]], working at the forefront of electronics research. In 1970, he accepted an offer from [[Macquarie University]] to become the founding Professor of Electronics and took up the post in 1971. During his fifteen years at Macquarie, Aitchison was well known for his dedication to his students and his insistence on keeping up to date with the latest laboratory techniques, experiments and equipment for his students. This was necessary to ensure that the university was keeping in pace with the rapid changes in the electronics industry at the time.

==Macquarie University==

At Macquarie, he taught electronics, with an emphasis on semiconductor physics, to advanced undergraduates and graduate students.  He also led several successful projects of a highly practical nature including pioneering work on the reception of satellite weather pictures that were shown every evening in Sydney's TV newscasts.

Aitchison became a good friend of famed physicist [[John Clive Ward]] and he was an active supporter, and participant, of the successful [[Macquarie science reform movement]].<ref>J. C. Ward, ''Memoirs of a Theoretical Physicist'' (Optics Journal, Rochester, New York, 2004) Chapter 13.</ref><ref>[[F. J. Duarte]], [http://www.opticsjournal.com/AUSTRALIAN%20PHYSICS%2046%286%29%20171-175%20%282009%29.pdf The man behind an identity in quantum electrodynamics, ''Australian Physics'' '''46''' (6), 171-175 (2009)].</ref><ref name=LP2012>[http://www.opticsjournal.com/laserphysicist.htm F.

Duarte, ''Laser Physicist'' (Optics Journal, New York, 2012)].</ref> It was Aitchison, Head of the School of Mathematics and Physics and member of Macquarie's Academic Senate, that conveyed the news to [[F. J. Duarte|Duarte]], that the Senate had approved the reforms advocated by the scientists.<ref name=LP2012 />

==Achievements==

* The scientific calculator with speech output for blind students. Aitchison's passion in his later years at Macquarie University was the development of the Speakwriter, a typewriter which enunciated the sounds of typewriter keys as they were pressed. An article written by Tony Healy in Computing Australia (1/9/86) quotes Tim Connell now working for Quantum Technology: “We saw Professor Aitchison on TV with his (talking) typewriter and realised we could do that.” Aitchison developed the talking typewriter originally to help a blind student complete a standard science course. His ideas can now be seen in many of the products available today made for people with vision impairment.

* The completion of the design, construction and commissioning of an orbiting National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) satellite for remote sensing.

* The development of solid-state pulse modulators for driving hydrogen [[thyratron]]s and for replacing hydrogen thyratrons in pulsed lasers. As a result of his work in these fields and his forty years teaching experience, he was awarded the status of Emeritus Professor of Electronics.

* Ron Aitchison was a [[Australian Institute of Physics|Fellow of the Australian Institute of Physics]], a Fellow of the [[Institute of Physics]] (London),  and a Fellow of the IREE.<ref>''Macquarie University Calendar'' (Macquarie University, North Ryde, 1983).</ref>

==Later years==

He retired July 4, 1986. In the words of Professor Frederick Chong, (Foundation Professor of Mathematics, Macquarie University, 1966–1980): "No problem was too peculiar for him. We knew that he could call on the most sophisticated of electronic devices, but he might also improvise with matchsticks, chewing gum and string! I can say that Ron Aitchison was one of the most energetic, most knowledgeable, most practical, most intelligent and most interesting persons I have ever known, and even more importantly, he was a real friend with a heart of gold and a purity of spirit unsullied by self-seeking motives."

==Publications==

Aitchison's most cited paper, according to the ISI database, is his 1954 paper on transparent semiconducting films - which is still cited to this day. Also his 1964 paper in Am. J. Phys. is notable as it is still cited today and was the first calculation of the resistance between two points on an infinite 2D mesh.
