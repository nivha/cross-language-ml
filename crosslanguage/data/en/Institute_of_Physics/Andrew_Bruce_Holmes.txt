'''Andrew Bruce Holmes''', [[Member of the Order of Australia|AM]] [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] [[Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science|FAA]] [[Institute of Physics|FinstP]] (born 5 September 1943) is an [[Australia]]n and [[United Kingdom|British]] senior research chemist and professor at the [[Bio21 Institute]], [[Melbourne]], Australia. His research interests lie in the synthesis of biologically-active [[natural products]] (spanning therapeutic materials to new biotechnological probes) and [[OLED|optoelectronic polymers]] (with applications to [[electroluminescent]] [[Rollable display|flexible displays]] and [[organic solar cells]]).

==Career==

Andrew Holmes' undergraduate studies and masters' research were conducted at the [[University of Melbourne]] in Australia. Travelling to the UK on a Shell Overseas Science Scholarship, he performed his PhD work at [[University College London]] under the supervision of [[Franz Sondheimer]].

As a postdoctoral researcher, Holmes worked on the [[Vitamin B12 total synthesis|total synthesis of Vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]] with [[Albert Eschenmoser]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=A. Holmes, H. Maag, N. Obata, P. Schneider, W. Schilling, J. Schreiber, and A. Eschenmoser | title = Total Synthese von Vitamin B12 | journal = Chimia | volume = 26 | issue = 320 | year = 1972 }}</ref>
In 1972 he was appointed as a [[Scientific demonstration|demonstrator]] to the [[University of Cambridge]] where he stayed for 32 years, ultimately as [[Professor]] of [[Organic chemistry|Organic]] and [[Polymer Chemistry]], and Director of the Melville Laboratory for Polymer Synthesis<ref>[http://www-melville.ch.cam.ac.uk/ Melville Laboratory for Polymer Synthesis]</ref> where he oversaw the founding and initial decade of the Melville Laboratory.

Holmes' early work at Cambridge expanded his interest in new techniques for synthesising small molecules that are biologically-active and practically-useful, including [[natural products]] (such as [[alkaloids]]) and [[peptidomimetic]]s. In 1989, during systematic characterisation of a newly synthesised [[conductive polymer]], [[Chloe Jennings]] working in Holmes' research group observed that the polymer emitted light when a current was passed through it. An intensive period of research in Holmes' group, and other polymer chemistry groups, led to the discovery of differently-coloured light-emitting polymers that spanned the visible colour spectrum. A subsequent collaboration with physicist [[Richard Friend]] and co-workers at Cambridge's [[Cavendish Laboratory]] revealed the potential of these [[Conjugated system|conjugated]] polymers for applications such as [[OLED|organic LEDs]] and [[rollable display]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v347/n6293/abs/347539a0.html | doi = 10.1038/347539a0 | accessdate = 2012-08-22

Friend and Holmes co-founded the company Cambridge Display Technologies<ref>[http://www.cdtltd.co.uk/ Cambridge Display Technologies]</ref> for commercial exploitation of these materials &ndash; an early success story of [[Silicon Fen]].

In 2004 Holmes returned to his native Australia on a [[Federation Fellowship]], to lead a group at the newly established [[Bio21 Institute]]. He has pursued the application of photovoltaic polymers to solar energy, and was instrumental in forming the Victorian Organic Solar Cell Consortium. He has also continued to develop new syntheses of novel, biologically-useful materials. An example is his groups' synthesis of [[phosphoinositides]], [[amphiphilic]] [[phospholipids]] situated in the [[cell membrane]], which collaborators at the [[Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research]] have used to probe the dynamics of [[signal transduction]] (intercellular signaling being an important component of many aspects of cell biology, including that of [[tumors]]).<ref>{{Cite pmid|20024134}}</ref>

Holmes has served on the editorial or advisory boards of numerous learned scientific journals, including [[Organic Letters]], [[Chemical Communications]] and [[Angewandte Chemie]]. In 2006, his 1998 paper on electroluminescent polymers was the most highly cited paper in Angewandte Chemie's 120-year history.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Kraft A, Grimsdale AC, Holmes AB

He was elected Fellow of the [[Royal Society]] in 2000, and Fellow of the [[Australian Academy of Science]] in 2006. In 2003, he received the [[Descartes Prize]] and in 2012 the [[Royal Medal]] of the Royal Society. His formal titles include Chemistry alumnus, Laureate Professor of Chemistry, University of Melbourne; CSIRO Fellow, CSIRO Division of Materials Science and Engineering; Emeritus Professor and Distinguished Research Fellow, Imperial College London; [[Fellow of the Royal Society]]; [[Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science]]; [[Fellow of the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering]]; and Foreign Secretary of the [[Australian Academy of Science]].  In 2004 he was appointed [[Member of the Order of Australia]] "For service to science through research and development, particularly in the fields of organic synthesis and polymer chemistry."<ref>[http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=1056020&search_type=quick&showInd=true Member of the Order of Australia] (AM), 26 January 2004, It's an Honour.</ref>  By August 2012 he had authored over 490 scientific papers and 52 patent applications.

Holmes is a keen hillwalker and an enthusiastic aficionado of classical music, from [[baroque]] to romantic [[opera]].<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/classic/content/2012/08/08/3562409.htm Margaret Throsby interviews Andrew Holmes], ABC Radio's Midday Program, 8 August 2012, www.abc.net.au/classic</ref> During his time in Cambridge he was a member and regular volunteer at St. Columba's [[United Reformed Church]]. He lives in [[Melbourne]] and [[Lorne, Victoria]] with his wife Jennifer.
