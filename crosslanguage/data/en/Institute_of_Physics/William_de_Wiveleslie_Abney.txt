'''Sir William de Wiveleslie Abney''', [[Order of the Bath|KCB]], [[Royal Society|FRS]] (24 July 1843 – 3 December 1920) was an [[England|English]] [[astronomer]], [[chemist]], and [[photographer]].

==Life and career==
Abney was born in [[Derby, England]], the son of Edward Abney (1811–1892) vicar of St Alkmund's Derby, and owner of the [[Firs Estate School Derby|Firs Estate]]. He attended [[Rossall School]], the [[Royal Military Academy, Woolwich]] and joined the [[Royal Engineers]] in 1861, with whom he served in [[India]] for several years. Thereafter, and to further his knowledge in photography, he became a chemical assistant at the [[Royal School of Military Engineering|Chatham School of Military Engineering]].

Abney was a pioneer of several technical aspects of [[photography]]. His father had been an early photographic experimenter and friend of [[Richard Keene]], an early Derby photographer. Keene became a close friend of William and his brother Charles Edward Abney (1850–1914). Both Abney sons subsequently became founder members of the Derby Photographic Society in June 1884.<ref>Craven, Maxwell (1993). Keene's Derby. Breedon Books. pp. 13–14. ISBN 1-873626-60-6.</ref> His endeavors in the [[chemistry]] of photography produced useful photographic products and also developments in astronomy. He wrote many books on photography that were considered standard texts at the time, although he was doubtful that his improvements would have a great impact on the subject.

Abney investigated the blackening of a negative to incidental light. In 1874, Abney developed a dry photographic [[emulsion]], which replaced "wet" emulsions. He used this emulsion in an [[Egypt]]ian expedition to photograph the transit of [[Venus]] across the [[sun]]. In 1880, he introduced [[hydroquinone]]. Abney also introduced new and useful types of photographic paper, including in 1882 a formula for gelatin [[silver chloride]] paper.

Abney conducted early research into the field of [[spectroscopy]], developing a red-sensitive emulsion which was used for the [[infrared]] [[Electromagnetic spectrum|spectra]] of [[organic molecule]]s. He was also a pioneer in photographing the [[infrared]] [[Sun|solar]] [[Absorption spectrum|spectrum]] (1887), as well as researching [[sunlight]] in the medium of the atmosphere.

He became assistant secretary to the Board of Education in 1899 and advisor to that body in 1903.<ref>[[Chambers Biographical Dictionary]], ISBN 0-550-18022-2, page 5</ref> In 1900 he was Director of the Science and Art Department. He sold his fathers estate, most of which went for housing in the [[St Luke's Parish Derby|St Luke's Parish]] of Derby, but retained 11 acres until 1913 when they were purchased by the [[Local government in the United Kingdom|Council]] to become the site of [[Rykneld Secondary Modern School Derby|Rykneld Secondary Modern School]] and Rykneld [[recreation ground]].[http://www.derby.gov.uk/LeisureCulture/ParksRecreation/Rykneldrec.htm]

Abney invented the "[[Topographic Abney Level]]", a combined [[clinometer]] and [[spirit level]], used by [[Surveyor (surveying)|surveyor]]s to measure [[slope]]s and [[angle]]s.

He died in [[Folkestone]], [[England]].

==Quotes==
* "''[...] whatever little notions of art a person might have in his head would certainly be driven out of it, for the knowledge that he could take an almost unlimited number of pictures would lead him to expose a sheet on every possible occasion, and probably 99 percent of what he obtained would be thoroughly inartistic productions''".
