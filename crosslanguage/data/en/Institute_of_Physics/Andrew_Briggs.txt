'''George Andrew Davidson Briggs''' (born 1950) (known as '''Andrew Briggs''') is a British scientist.

He is Professor of [[Nanomaterials]] in the [[Department of Materials, University of Oxford|Department of Materials]] at the University of Oxford. He is best known for his early work in [[acoustic microscopy]] and his current work in materials for quantum technologies.<ref name="php">{{cite web|url=http://www.materials.ox.ac.uk/peoplepages/briggs.html |title=University of Oxford |publisher=Materials.ox.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-01-20}}</ref>

== Early life and education ==

He was born in [[Dorchester, Dorset|Dorchester]], Dorset, son of [[David Briggs (English Headmaster)|David Briggs]],<ref name=WhoIsWho>[http://www.ukwhoswho.com/app?service=externalpagemethod&page=ArticleDisplay&method=view&sp=S/oupww/whoswho/U10000304 Who's Who]</ref> a classics teacher at [[Bryanston School]] Dorset, and later headmaster of [[King's College School|King’s College School]] Cambridge, and Mary (née Lormer),<ref name=WhoIsWho /> whose former maths pupils include [[Sir Timothy Gowers]] and [[Andrew Wiles|Sir Andrew Wiles]]. His younger sister is the broadcaster and writer [[Anne Atkins]].

He was educated at the [[Leys School]]<ref name=WhoIsWho /> Cambridge where he held a Major Scholarship and won the Lower and Upper Sixth Form Maths and Physics Prizes, the Natural History and Scientific Society Prize, and the W.L. Wood Prize. He studied physics at [[St Catherines College Oxford|St. Catherine’s College, Oxford]],<ref name=WhoIsWho /> from 1968-1971 as the [[Clothworkers]]’ Scholar.<ref name=WhoIsWho /> From 1973-1976 he undertook research for a Ph.D. at the [[Cavendish Laboratory]].<ref name=WhoIsWho /> From 1976-1979 he studied [[Theology]] at [[Ridley Hall]]<ref name=WhoIsWho /> and [[Queens’ College, Cambridge]],<ref name=WhoIsWho /> where he won the Chase Prize for Greek.

== Career ==

From 1971-1973 after graduating from his first degree, he taught Physics and Religious Education at [[Canford School]],<ref name=WhoIsWho /> Dorset. In 1979 he was a Research Assistant in the Engineering Department at Cambridge University.<ref name=WhoIsWho /> In 1980 moved to Oxford as a Research Fellow in the Department of [[Metallurgy]]<ref name=WhoIsWho /> and from 1981 Lecturer in Physics at St Catherine’s College.<ref name=WhoIsWho /> In 1984 he was appointed Lecturer in Metallurgy and Science of Materials<ref name=WhoIsWho /> at the University of Oxford, in 1996 Reader in Materials, and in 1999 Professor of Materials.<ref name=WhoIsWho /> In 2002 he was elected to the newly created Chair of [[Nanomaterials]]<ref name=WhoIsWho /> at the University of Oxford.<ref name="php" />  From 2002-2009 he was Director of the Quantum Information Processing Interdisciplinary Research Collaboration,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.materials.ox.ac.uk/research/qipirc.html |title=Quantum Information Processing Interdisciplinary Research Collaboration |publisher=Materials.ox.ac.uk |date=2004-04-01 |accessdate=2014-01-20}}</ref> and [[EPSRC]] Professorial Research Fellow.<ref name="JTF">{{cite web|url=http://www.templeton.org/who-we-are/our-team/board-of-advisors/andrew-briggs |title=John Templeton Foundation |publisher=Templeton.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-20}}</ref> Since 2010 he has also been responsible for the preparation and evaluation of grant proposals to [[Templeton Foundation|Templeton World Charity Foundation]] which serves as a philanthropic catalyst for discoveries relating to the Big Questions of human purpose and ultimate reality.<ref name="JTF" /> He has initiated a large number of research projects and related activities around the world, in topics such as spiritual discovery through science, science as a component of theology, the power of information, freedom and free enterprise, and character development.

He has published over 575 books, papers, and articles; the majority in internationally reviewed journals.<ref name="php" /><ref name="JTF" /> His scientific research since taking up the Chair of Nanomaterials in 2002 has concentrated on materials with potential for building [[quantum computers]]. These include molecules in which the quantum states of electron and nuclear spins can be controlled with exquisite precision. Having established the key necessary phenomena in ensembles of large numbers of spins, since 2013 he has focussed on harnessing quantum properties in devices. He has also shown how the materials and techniques developed for technologies can be used for investigating the nature of reality in the context of quantum theory.
