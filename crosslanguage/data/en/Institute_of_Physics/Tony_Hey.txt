== Education ==
Hey was educated at [[King Edward's School, Birmingham]]<ref name="whoswho"/> and the [[University of Oxford]]. He graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[physics]] in 1967, and a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] in [[theoretical physics]]<ref name="heyphd">{{cite thesis |degree=DPhil|first=Anthony|last=Hey |title=Experimental studies in elementary particle physics |publisher=University of Oxford |date=1971 |url=http://www.theses.com}}{{subscription required}}</ref> in 1970, from [[Worcester College, Oxford]] and [[St John's College, Oxford]].<ref name="whoswho"/>

==Career==
From 1970 through 1972 Hey was a [[Postdoctoral research|postdoctoral fellow]] at [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech).
Moving to [[Pasadena, California]], he worked with [[Richard Feynman]] and [[Murray Gell-Mann]], both winners of the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]].<ref name="newcastle"/>
He then moved to [[Geneva, Switzerland]] and worked as a fellow at [[CERN]] (the European organization for nuclear research) for two years.
Hey worked about thirty years as an academic at [[University of Southampton]], starting in 1974 as a [[Particle physics|particle physicist]].
He spent 1978 as a visiting fellow at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].
For 1981 he returned to Caltech as a visiting research professor. There he learned of [[Carver Mead]]'s work on [[very-large-scale integration]] and become interested in applying [[parallel computing]] techniques to large-scale scientific simulations.

Hey worked with British semiconductor company [[Inmos]] on the [[Transputer]] project in the 1980s. 
He switched to [[computer science]] in 1985, and in 1986 became professor of computation in the Department of Electronics and Computer Science at Southampton. While there, he was promoted to Head of the School of Electronics and Computer Science in 1994 and Dean of Engineering and Applied Science in 1999. 
Among his work  was "doing research on [[Unix]] with tools like [[LaTeX]]."<ref>{{Cite web |title= A Conversation with Microsoft's Tony Hey |work= Open and Shut? blog |author= Richard Poynder |date= 12 December 2006 |url= http://poynder.blogspot.com/2006/12/conversation-with-microsofts-tony-hey.html |accessdate= 20 September 2011 }} [http://dialspace.dial.pipex.com/town/parade/df04/Hey.pdf Full transcript] updated 15 December 2006.</ref> 
In 1990 he was a visiting fellow at the [[Thomas J. Watson Research Center]] of [[IBM Research]].
He then worked with [[Jack Dongarra]], Rolf Hempel and David Walker, to define the [[Message Passing Interface]] (MPI)<ref>{{cite doi|10.1007/BFb0002845}}</ref> which became a de facto open standard for parallel scientific computing.<ref>{{Cite journal |title= A Draft Standard for Message Passing in a Distributed Memory Environment |author1= [[Jack Dongarra]] |author2= Rolf Hempel |author3= A.

== Awards and honours==
Hey had an open scholarship to [[Worcester College, Oxford]] from 1963 to 1967, won the Scott Prize for Physics in 1967, senior scholarship to [[St John's College, Oxford]] in 1968 and was a [[Harkness Fellow]] from 1970 through 1972.<ref name="cv"/>
Hey was made a Commander of the [[Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) in 2005. He became a Fellow of the [[British Computer Society]] in 1996, the [[Institute of Physics]] and the [[Institution of Electrical Engineers]] in 1996 and the [[Royal Academy of Engineering]] in 2001.<ref name="cv"/>
In 2006 he presented the prestigious IET [[Pinkerton Lecture]]. In 2007 he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Civil Law degree from [[Newcastle University]].<ref name="newcastle">{{Cite web |title= Anthony John Grenville ("Tony") Hey |work= Citation for honorary degree |publisher= University of Newcastle |year= 2012 |author= Professor Paul Younger |url= http://www.ncl.ac.uk/computing/research/hon/hey/ |accessdate= 26 March 2014 }}</ref>
