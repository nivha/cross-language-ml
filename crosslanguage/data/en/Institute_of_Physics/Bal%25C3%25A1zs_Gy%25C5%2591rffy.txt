'''Balázs László Győrffy''' (4 May 1938 – 25 October 2012) was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]]-[[United States|American]]-[[United Kingdom|British]] [[theoretical physicist]]. In his obituary, the ''[[Times Higher Education]]'' described him as "one of the dominant international figures in the development of the theory of [[Condensed matter physics|condensed matter]]".<ref name=parr/> Gyorffy is thought to be the first person to use the term "electron glue" to describe the sea of electrons binding together the nuclei in materials.<ref name=parr>Chris Parr, "Balázs Győrffy, 1938-2012", Times Higher Education 13 Dec 2012. http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/balzs-gyorffy-1938-2012/422082.article</ref>

One of Győrffy's main contributions was as one of the pioneers of the application of the [[Korringa–Kohn–Rostoker approximation|Korringa–Kohn–Rostoker]] [[coherent potential approximation]] (KKR-CPA) for first-principle calculations of the [[electronic structure]] of [[alloy]]s.<ref>G.M. Stocks, W.M. Temmerman and B.L. Gyorffy, [[Physical Review Letters]] 41(5), 339-343 (1978).</ref> He is also known for the Gaspari-Gyorffy method for obtaining the strength of electron-phonon coupling in [[transition metals]] [[superconductors]].<ref>G. D. Gaspari and B.L. Gyorffy. Electron-Phonon Interactions, ''d'' Resonances, and Superconductivity in Transition Metals. [[Physical Review Letters]] 28(13), 801-805 (1972). {{doi|10.1103/PhysRevLett.28.801}}.</ref> 

Győrffy was born in [[Eger]] in 1938,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mta.hu/koztestuleti_tagok?PersonId=19076|title=Győrffy Balázs|website=[[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]]|accessdate=23 July  2014}}</ref> but fled his native Hungary for the U.S. following the Russian invasion in 1956. He was a swimmer of Olympic standard, and this enabled him to secure a sports scholarship at  [[Yale University]]. Győrffy went on to receive a B.S. and Ph.D. from [[Yale|Yale University]], where he studied under [[Nobel prize]] winner [[Willis Lamb]]. Since 1970 he was associated with the [[University of Bristol]], where he was a lecturer (1970–1980), reader (1980–1987) and professor (from 1987 onwards). He was an Emeritus professor in Physics at that university until his death in 2012.  He also held visiting positions at [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]], [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]], [[Institut Laue-Langevin]], the [[University of Toronto]], and the [[Technical University of Vienna]].<ref name=evans>{{cite web|url=http://www.bristol.ac.uk/physics/media/BalazsLGyorffyObituary.pdf|title=Balazs L. Gyorffy 1938-2012|first=Robert|last=Evans|publisher=University of Bristol|date=14 November 2012}}</ref>

He was elected an external member of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]] in 1995, Fellow of the [[Institute of Physics]] in 1998, was a co-recipient of the [[Gordon Bell Prize]] in 1998, and was given the 2001 William Hume-Rothery award by the [[The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society]].<ref>[http://www.tms.org/Society/Honors/2001/HumeRothery2001.html William Hume-Rothery award citation, 2001]</ref><ref name=evans/>

He died from cancer on 25 October 2012, aged 74.<ref name=parr/>
