Saunders attended the girls-only [[Portsmouth High School (Southsea)|Portsmouth High School]], before attending Nottingham University to study physics.  She became [[Leyland Motors|Leyland's]] first female graduate engineer, on an electronic engineering apprenticeship, eventually leaving due to frustration that the electronic systems she worked on were not used on mass-production scales.  This was when she joined the RSRE and started a part-time PhD in liquid crystal devices.<ref name=IoPInteractions>{{cite journal|last=Pinnell|first=Heather|title=Pioneer prepares for a new challenge|journal=Interactions|date=July 2013|url=http://members.iop.org/members/interactions/INTJuly13finalLast.pdf|accessdate=19 August 2013|publisher=Institute of Physics}}</ref>
