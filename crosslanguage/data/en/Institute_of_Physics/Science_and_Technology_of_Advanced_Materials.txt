'''''Science and Technology of Advanced Materials''''' is a bimonthly [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[scientific journal]] in [[materials science]] that was established in 2000. In 2008 it became an [[open access journal]] through the sponsorship of the [[National Institute for Materials Science]] (NIMS, [[Tsukuba, Ibaraki]], Japan). The journal is international, with its editors and referees located all around the world. It is managed by NIMS, which was joined in 2014 by the [[Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology]] (Empa).<ref>[http://ioppublishing.org/newsDetails/global-partnership-signed-to-expand-opportunities-for-open-access-publishing-in-materials-science Global partnership signed to expand opportunities for open access publishing in materials science]. ioppublishing.org. 31 January 2014</ref> From 2008, the journal is published on-line by [[IOP Publishing]], whereas prior to 2008 it was published by [[Elsevier]].

== Scope ==
The journal covers all aspects of materials science, including theoretical analysis, synthesis and processing, phase and structure analyses, characterization, properties, engineering, and applications. It covers advances in research on solids, liquids and colloids, with emphasis on the interdisciplinary nature of materials science and issues at the forefront of the field, such as nano-, bio- and ecomaterials.
