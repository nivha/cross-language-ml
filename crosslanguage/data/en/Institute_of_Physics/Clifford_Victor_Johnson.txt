'''Clifford Victor Johnson''' is an [[England|English]] [[theoretical physicist]] and [[professor]] at the [[University of Southern California]] Department of Physics and Astronomy. His research focus is in [[superstring theory]] and [[particle physics]], specifically related to strongly coupled phenomena.<ref>[http://www.sciencenews.org/view/feature/id/42632/title/Strings_Link_the_Ultracold_with_the_Superhot Strings Link the Ultracold With the Superhot] ''Science News'', April 25, 2009,</ref><ref>[http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2009/02/string-theory-officially-useful-may-not-represent-reality.ars String Theory Officially Useful, May Not Represent Reality] ''Ars Technica'', February 17, 2009</ref> He has previously worked at the [[Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics]] at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] and [[Princeton University]].<ref>[http://college.usc.edu/cf/faculty-and-staff/faculty.cfm?pid=1003388&CFID=7339566&CFTOKEN=89505218 Faculty Profile]</ref> He received the 2005 [[Maxwell Medal and Prize]] from the Institute of Physics, "For his outstanding contribution to string theory, quantum gravity and its interface with strongly coupled field theory; in particular for his work on understanding the censorship of singularities, and the thermodynamic properties, of quantum spacetime."<ref>[http://www.iop.org/activity/awards/Early_career_awards/The_Maxwell_Medal_and_Prize/Maxwell_medal_recipients/page_10193.html Recipients of the Maxwell Medal and Prize] Institute of Physics</ref><ref>[http://cerncourier.com/cws/article/cern/29175/2 Faces and Places] ''Cern Courier'' October 4, 2004</ref><ref>[http://college.usc.edu/news/stories/38/u-k-society-lauds-usc-college-physics-professor/ U.K. Society Lauds USC College Professor] ''USC College News'' October 1, 2004</ref><ref>[http://www.pbs.org/kcet/wiredscience/education/2008/01/careers-in-science-professor-o.html Careers in Science: Professor of Physics] ''Wired Science'' January 11, 2008</ref> He received a [[National Science Foundation]] Career Award in 1997.<ref>[http://college.usc.edu/cf/faculty-and-staff/faculty.cfm?pid=1003388&CFID=7339566&CFTOKEN=89505218 Faculty Profile]</ref> In 2005, the Journal of Blacks in Higher Education listed Clifford Johnson as the most highly cited black professor of mathematics or a related field at an American university or college.<ref>[http://www.jbhe.com/news_views/49_mostcited_blackmathematicians.html The Most Highly Cited Black Mathematicians] ''The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education'' 2005</ref>

He graduated with a [[Bachelor of Science]] in Physics from [[Imperial College London]] in 1989 and he completed his [[Doctor of Philosophy]] in Mathematics and Physics from the [[University of Southampton]] in 1992.

He also actively works to promote science in the public. As part of this effort, he regularly appears on the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] series ''The Universe'' and acts as a science consultant for the [[Discovery Channel]].<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/2008/dec/07/entertainment/ca-physics7 Prime Time Makes a Scientific Discovery] ''Los Angeles Times'', December 7, 2008</ref> Johnson founded the African Summer Theory Institute, "which brings teachers, researchers, and students of all levels together for a month-long conference on a science topic—a different one every year—to discuss, to network, and, of course, to learn." <ref>[http://www.myhero.com/myhero/hero.asp?hero=clifford_johnson_06 Science Hero: Clifford V.
