Recent evidence for [[gravitational wave]]s from the [[Big Bang]] appear to provide evidence against this model though the claim that the [[BICEP2|BICEP2 experiment]] has detected gravitational waves awaits confirmation.<ref>[http://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/mar/18/stephen-hawking-gravitational-wave-bet-big-bang Stephen Hawking claims victory in gravitational wave bet]</ref>

==Early life and career==
[[File:NeilTurok1990.jpg|thumb|Neil Turok circa 1990]]

Turok was born in [[Johannesburg]], [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]], to Mary (Butcher) and Latvian-born [[Ben Turok]], who were activists in the [[Internal resistance to South African apartheid|anti-apartheid movement]] and the [[African National Congress]]. After graduating from [[Churchill College]], Cambridge, Turok gained his doctorate from [[Imperial College]], London, under the supervision of [[David Olive|Professor David Olive]], one of the inventors of [[superstring theory]]. After a postdoctoral post at Santa Barbara, he was an associate scientist at [[Fermilab]], Chicago. In 1992 he was awarded the [[Maxwell Medal and Prize|Maxwell medal]] of the [[Institute of Physics]] for his contributions to theoretical physics. In 1994 he was appointed Professor of Physics at [[Princeton University]], then held the [[Chair of Mathematical Physics at the University of Cambridge]] starting in 1997. He was appointed Director of the [[Perimeter Institute]] in 2008.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.perimeterinstitute.ca/people/Neil-Turok|date=2013|accessdate=2014-01-17|title=Perimeter Institute Executive Director Biography}}</ref>

==Research and other contributions==
Turok has worked in a number of areas of mathematical physics and early universe physics, focusing on observational tests of fundamental physics in [[physical cosmology|cosmology]]. In the early 1990s, his group showed how the polarisation and temperature anisotropies of the [[cosmic background radiation]] would be correlated, a prediction which has been confirmed in detail by recent precision measurements by the [[WMAP]] spacecraft. They also developed a key test for the presence of a [[cosmological constant]], also recently confirmed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/space/1112693405/dark-energy-universe-expansion-rate-is-real-091312/|date=2012|accessdate=2012-11-02|title=Dark Energy Almost 100 Percent Proven}}</ref>

Turok and collaborators developed the theory of [[open inflation]].  With [[Stephen Hawking]], he later developed the so-called Hawking-Turok [[instanton]] solutions which, according to the no-boundary proposal of Hawking and [[James Hartle]], can describe the birth of an [[inflationary universe]].

Most recently, with [[Paul Steinhardt]] at Princeton, Turok has been developing a [[cyclic model]] for the universe, in which the big bang is explained as a collision between two "brane-worlds" in [[M theory]]. The predictions of this model are in agreement with current cosmological data, but there are interesting differences with the predictions of cosmological inflation which will be probed by future experiments (probably by the [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck]] space observatory). In 2006, Steinhardt and Turok showed how the cyclic model could naturally incorporate a mechanism for relaxing the [[cosmological constant]] to very small values, consistent with current observations. In 2007, Steinhardt and Turok co-authored the popular science book ''[[Endless Universe]]''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=|date=2012|accessdate=2012-11-02|title=Endless Universe, P.J. Steinhardt and N.G. Turok, Doubleday, 2007. }}</ref> In 2012, Turok's Massey Lectures  were published as ''[[The Universe Within: from quantum to cosmos]]''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=|date=2012|accessdate=2012-11-02|title=The Universe Within: from quantum to cosmos, Neil Turok, Anansi, 2012}}</ref>

In 2003, Turok founded the [[African Institute for Mathematical Sciences]] in [[Muizenberg]], a postgraduate educational centre supporting the development of mathematics and science across the African continent.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v474/n7353/abs/474567a.html|date=2012|accessdate=2012-11-02|title=Africa AIMS High, Nature 474,567–569(30 June 2011)}}</ref>

==Awards and honours==
He was awarded the 2008 [[TED (conference)|TED]] Prize for his work in mathematical physics and in establishing the [[African Institute for Mathematical Sciences]] in [[Muizenberg]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://blog.ted.com/2007/11/announcing_2008.php|date=2007|accessdate=2007-11-21|title=TED Blog: Announcing 2008 TED Prize Winners}}</ref> He also received a "Most Innovative People Award," for Social Innovation, at the World Summit on Innovation and Entrepreneurship (WSIE) in 2008.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thewsie.org/prologue.html|date=2012|accessdate=2012-11-02|title=World Summit on Innovation and Entrepreneurship}}</ref>

On May 9, 2008, [[Mike Lazaridis]] announced that Turok would become the new Executive Director of the [[Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics]] starting on October 1, 2008.

In 2010 Turok received a prize from the [[World Innovation Summit for Education]] in Qatar<ref>[http://www.wise-qatar.org/node/1306 WISE Awards 2010]</ref> and an award from the [[South African Mathematical Society]].<ref>http://aims.ac.za/en/about/aims-news/sams_award</ref> In 2011 Turok received an Honorary Doctorate from the University of Ottawa.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.media.uottawa.ca/mediaroom/news-details_2340.html|date=2011|accessdate=2011-06-09|title=190th University of Ottawa Convocation: Exceptional students and outstanding personalities honoured}}</ref>

On November 3, 2011, Turok was selected to deliver the [[Massey Lectures]] for the 2012 season.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/ideas/episodes/massey-lectures/2012/11/12/the-2012-cbc-massey-lecture-the-universe-within/|date=2012|accessdate=2012-11-02|title=The 2012 CBC Massey Lectures, "The Universe Within: From Quantum to Cosmos}}</ref> This involves five separate lectures to be delivered in various locations across Canada in October 2012, aired on CBC's ''[[Ideas (radio show)|Ideas]]'' shortly thereafter.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/you-dont-understand-quantum-physics-neil-turok-will-help-you/article4610576/|date=2012|accessdate=2012-11-02|title=You don't understand quantum theory?

On May 16, 2014, Dr. Turok was awarded the Honorary degree of Doctor of Science, Honoris Causa from Saint Mary's University.<ref>http://www.smu.ca/about/news/2014/five-exemplary-leaders-to-receive-honorary-degrees-from-saint-marys-university.html</ref>
