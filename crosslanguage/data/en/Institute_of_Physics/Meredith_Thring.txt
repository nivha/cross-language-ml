'''Meredith Wooldridge Thring''' (17 December 1915 â€“ 15 September 2006) was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[inventor]], [[engineer]], [[futurologist]], [[professor]] and [[author]].

==Education and career==
Thring was born in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]], but moved to [[England]] when he was four years old.  His school was [[Malvern College]]. He obtained a double first class degree in [[Mathematics]] and [[Physics]] at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] in 1937. He then joined the [[British Coal Utilisation Research Association]], becoming Head of its Combustion Research Laboratory.  In 1940, he married Margaret Hooley (died 1986), and they had two sons and one daughter. 

In 1946 Thring became Head of the newly formed Physics Research group of the [[British Iron and Steel Research Association]]. In 1950 he moved to the [[University of Sheffield]], becoming Professor and Head of the Department of Fuel Technology and [[Chemical Engineering]] in 1953. In 1964 he took up the position of Head of the Department of [[Mechanical Engineering]] at [[Queen Mary, University of London|Queen Mary College]] of the [[University of London]], where he remained until his retirement in 1981. He died in [[Exmouth]], [[Devon]].

==Honours==
Thring was awarded the Student Medal of the [[Energy Institute|Institute of Fuel]] in 1938, and the Hadfield Medal of the [[Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining|Iron and Steel Institute]]. From 1962 to 1963 he was President of the [[Energy Institute|Institute of Fuel]]. In 1964 he was awarded a doctorate [[ScD]] degree from [[University of Cambridge]].  He was a Fellow of the [[Institute of Physics]], the [[Energy Institute|Institute of Fuel]], the [[Institution of Mechanical Engineers]], the [[Institution of Engineering and Technology|Institution of Electrical Engineers]] and the [[Institution of Chemical Engineers]].  He was one of the first Fellows of the [[Royal Academy of Engineering]].

==Work==
Thring was a visionary who changed from science to engineering "because he wanted to make the world a better place".<ref>[http://news.independent.co.uk/people/obituaries/article1772293.ece Rob Thring (his son) ''The Independent'', 30 September 2006]</ref> In his 1977 book ''How to Invent'', he wrote "One can envisage a society in which man lives in near-equilibrium with his environment, with the minimum use of raw materials by fuel economy, complete recycling of all metals, no throw-away goods, all consumer goods built to last many decades, and near zero pollution.".<ref>M. W. Thring & E. R. Laithwaite (1977) ''How to Invent'' ISBN 0-333-22026-9</ref>  In the same book he describes domestic and gardening tools, [[Intermediate Technology]] for less developed countries and robots to take the place of people in dangerous situations. However, these were not just imagining. At the [[University of Sheffield]] and [[Queen Mary, University of London|Queen Mary College]] he was actively involved in [[robotics]], and after his retirement founded a charity called [[Power Aid]] to help developing countries.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/obituaries/story/0,,1944163,00.html Frank Fitzgerald, The Guardian, 10 November 2006]</ref> In 1969 he predicted a future in which factories would be largely automatic, controlled by a central computer, and supposed that this would reduce the human working week to 10 or 20 hours.<ref>''The Times'' September 11, 1969 "Robots that will remove drudgery"</ref>

He studied combustion and other forms of energy generation, and was one of the founders of the International Flame Research Foundation in 1955.  This knowledge of energy was shown in his 1974 book ''Energy and Humanity'' which called essentially for a more rational and sustainable approach, with control of pollution.  He was also known as a teacher, and for his belief that engineers had an ethical obligation to improve life for all, but notably the underprivileged and disabled.<ref>[http://www.combustion.org.uk/newsletter/newslettermar07/thring.html Roy Crookes ''Combustion Institute, British Section Newsletter'' March 2007]</ref>
