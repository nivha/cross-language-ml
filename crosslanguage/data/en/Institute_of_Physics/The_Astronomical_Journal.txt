'''''The Astronomical Journal''''' (often abbreviated ''AJ'' in scientific papers and references) is a [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] monthly [[scientific journal]] owned by the [[American Astronomical Society]] and currently published by [[IOP Publishing]]. It is one of the premier journals for astronomy in the world. Until 2008, the journal was published by the [[University of Chicago Press]] on behalf of the [[American Astronomical Society]].<ref>{{cite web

The other two publications of the society, the ''[[Astrophysical Journal]]'' and its supplement series, followed in January 2009.<ref>{{cite web

The journal was established in 1849 by [[Benjamin A. Gould]]. It ceased publication in 1861 due to the [[American Civil War]], but resumed in 1885. Between 1909 and 1941 the journal was edited in Albany, New York. In 1941, editor Benjamin Boss arranged to transfer responsibility for the journal to the American Astronomical Society.

The first electronic edition of ''The Astronomical Journal'' was published in January, 1998. With the July, 2006 issue, ''The Astronomical Journal'' began ''e-first'' publication, an electronic version of the journal released independently of the hardcopy issues. Its current [[editor-in-chief]] is [[John Gallagher III]] ([[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]).
