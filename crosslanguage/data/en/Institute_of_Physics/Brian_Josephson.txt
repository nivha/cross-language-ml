'''Brian David Josephson''', {{Post-nominals|country=GBR|FRS}} (born 4 January 1940), is a Welsh theoretical physicist and professor emeritus of physics at the [[University of Cambridge]].<ref>[http://www.phy.cam.ac.uk/people/emeritus.php "Emeritus Faculty Staff List"], Department of Physics, Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge.</ref> Best known for his pioneering work on [[superconductivity]] and [[quantum tunnelling]], he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1973 for his prediction of the eponymous [[Josephson effect]], made in 1962 when he was a 22-year-old PhD student at Cambridge. He shared the prize with physicists [[Leo Esaki]] and [[Ivar Giaever]], who jointly received half the award for their own work on quantum tunnelling.<ref name=britannica>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/306448/Brian-D-Josephson "Brian D. Josephson"], ''Encyclopædia Britannica''.</ref>

Josephson has spent his academic career as a member of the Theory of Condensed Matter group at Cambridge's [[Cavendish Laboratory]]. He has been a fellow of [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]] since 1962, and served as professor of physics from 1974 until 2007.<ref name=britannica/>

In the early 1970s Josephson took up [[transcendental meditation]] and turned his attention to issues outside the parameters of mainstream science. He set up the Mind–Matter Unification Project at the Cavendish to explore the idea of intelligence in nature, the relationship between [[quantum mechanics]] and [[consciousness]], and the synthesis of science and Eastern mysticism, broadly known as [[quantum mysticism]].<ref>[http://talks.cam.ac.uk/show/index/12217 "Mind–Matter Unification Project (TCM Group, Cavendish Laboratory)"], University of Cambridge.

Josephson was known at Cambridge as a brilliant, but shy, student. Physicist John Waldram recalled overhearing [[Nicholas Kurti]] (1908–1998), an examiner from Oxford, discuss Josephson's exam results with [[David Shoenberg]], then reader in physics at Cambridge, and asking: "Who is this chap Josephson? He seems to be going through the theory like a knife through butter."<ref>[http://sms.cam.ac.uk/media/1276329 Waldram 2012], 2:58 mins.
*For the shyness, see Alexei Kojevnikov, [http://www.aip.org/history/ohilist/23362_3.html "Interview with Dr. Philip Anderson"], Session III, Princeton Physics Department Building, 23 November 1999.</ref> While still an undergraduate, he published a paper on the [[Mössbauer effect]], pointing out a crucial issue other researchers had overlooked. According to one eminent physicist speaking to ''Physics World'', he wrote several papers important enough to assure him a place in the history of physics even without his discovery of the Josephson effect.<ref name="Physics World">{{cite web|author=Edwin Cartlidge|date=May 2002|title=Pioneer of the Paranormal|url=http://www.tcm.phy.cam.ac.uk/~bdj10/mm/articles/PWprofile.html|work=Physics World}}</ref>

He graduated in 1960 and became a research student in the university's [[New Museums Site|Mond Laboratory]] on the old Cavendish site, where he was supervised by [[Brian Pippard]] (1920–2008).<ref>For the graduation date, see [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/306448/Brian-D-Josephson "Brian D.

Josephson was 22 years old when he did the work on [[quantum tunnelling]] that won him the Nobel Prize. He discovered that a [[Superconductivity|supercurrent]] could tunnel through a thin barrier, predicting, according to physicist Andrew Whitaker, that "at a junction of two superconductors, a current will flow even if there is no drop in voltage; that when there is a voltage drop, the current should oscillate at a frequency related to the drop in voltage; and that there is a dependence on any magnetic field."<ref>Andrew Whitaker, ''The New Quantum Age: From Bell's Theorem to Quantum Computation and Teleportation'', Oxford University Press, 2012, [http://books.google.com/books?id=BaiRvOSaPkwC&pg=PA273 p. 273].</ref> This became known as the Josephson effect and the junction as a Josephson junction.<ref>James S. Trefil, "Josephson Effect," ''The Nature of Science'', Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2003, [http://books.google.com/books?id=JVj9SylSuB4C&pg=PA225 p. 225].

His calculations were published in ''Physics Letters'' (chosen by Pippard because it was a new journal that did not charge fees for publication) in a paper entitled "Possible new effects in superconductive tunnelling," received on 8 June 1962 and published on 1 July.<ref>B. D. Josephson, [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0031916362913690 "Possible new effects in superconductive tunnelling"], ''Physics Letters'', 1(7), 1 July 1962 (received 8 June 1962), pp. 251–253.

*For the page charges, see [http://www.aip.org/history/ohilist/23362_3.html Kojevnikov 1999].</ref> They were confirmed experimentally by Philip Anderson and John Rowell of [[Bell Labs]] in Princeton; this appeared in their paper, "Probable Observation of the Josephson Superconducting Tunneling Effect," submitted to ''Physical Review Letters'' in January 1963.<ref>Philip Anderson and John Rowell, [http://prl.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v10/i6/p230_1 "Probable Observation of the Josephson Superconducting Tunneling Effect"], ''Physical Review Letters'', 10(6), 15 March 1963 (received 11 January 1963), pp. 230–232.</ref>

Before Anderson and Rowell confirmed the calculations, the American physicist [[John Bardeen]] (1908–1991), who had shared the 1956 Nobel Prize in Physics (and who shared it again in 1972), objected to Josephson's work. He submitted an article to ''Physical Review Letters'' on 25 July 1962, arguing that "there can be no such superfluid flow." The disagreement led to a famous confrontation in September that year at [[Queen Mary, University of London|Queen Mary College, London]], at the Eighth International Conference on Low Temperature Physics. When Bardeen (then one of the most eminent physicists in the world) began speaking, Josephson (still a student) stood up and interrupted him. The men exchanged views, reportedly in a civil and soft-spoken manner. Donald G. McDonald described the discussion as "youth versus maturity, daring spirit versus depth of experience, and mathematics versus intuition." Josephson, as it turned out, was right.<ref>Donald G. McDonald, [http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/magazine/physicstoday/article/54/7/10.1063/1.1397394 "The Nobel Laureate Versus the Graduate Student]", ''Physics Today'', July 2001, pp. 46–51.

Whitaker writes that the discovery of the Josephson effect led to "much important physics," including the invention of [[SQUID]]s (superconducting quantum interference devices), which are used in geology to make highly sensitive measurements, as well as in medicine and computing.<ref>Whitaker 2012, [http://books.google.com/books?id=BaiRvOSaPkwC&pg=PA273 pp. 273–274].

Josephson was awarded several important prizes for his discovery, including the 1969 [[Research Corporation]] Award for outstanding contributions to science,<ref name=Sullivan17Dec1969>Brian Sullivan, [http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1913&dat=19691217&id=WH0gAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-mcFAAAAIBAJ&pg=2623,5911644 "Physics is Often a Young Man's Game"], Associated Press, 17 December 1969.</ref> and the [[Hughes Medal]] and [[Holweck Prize]] in 1972. In 1973 he won the Nobel Prize in Physics, sharing the $122,000 award with two other scientists who had also worked on quantum tunnelling. Josephson was awarded half the prize "for his theoretical predictions of the properties of a supercurrent through a tunnel barrier, in particular those phenomena which are generally known as the Josephson effects."<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1973/index.html "The Nobel Prize in Physics 1973"], Nobelprize.org; for $122,000, see [http://www.jstor.org/stable/3958218 "From Stockholm, with Love"], ''Science News'', 104(17), 27 October 1973 (pp. 260–261), p. 260.</ref>

The other half of the award was shared equally by Japanese physicist [[Leo Esaki]] of the Thomas Watson Research Center in Yorktown, New York, and Norwegian-American physicist [[Ivar Giaever]] of General Electric in Schenectady, New York, "for their experimental discoveries regarding tunneling phenomena in semiconductors and superconductors, respectively."<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1973/index.html "The Nobel Prize in Physics 1973"], Nobelprize.org.

===Positions held===
Josephson spent a postdoctoral year in the United States (1965–1966) as research assistant professor at the [[University of Illinois]]. After returning to Cambridge, he was made assistant director of research at the Cavendish Laboratory in 1967, where he remained a member of the Theory of Condensed Matter group, a theoretical physics group, for the rest of his career.<ref>[http://www.tcm.phy.cam.ac.uk/ "Cambridge Theory of Condensed Matter group"], University of Cambridge, accessed 14 October 2009.</ref> He was elected a fellow of the [[Royal Society]] in 1970, and the same year was awarded a [[National Science Foundation]] fellowship by [[Cornell University]], where he spent one year. In 1972 he became a [[Reader (academic rank)|reader]] in physics at Cambridge and in 1974 a full professor, a position he held until he retired in 2007.<ref name="Nobel CV">[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1973/josephson-bio.html "Brian D. Josephson"], in Stig Lundqvist (ed.), ''Nobel Lectures, Physics 1971–1980'', World Scientific Publishing Co., 1992.</ref>

A practitioner of [[transcendental meditation]] (TM) since the early seventies, Josephson became a visiting faculty member in 1975 of the [[Transcendental Meditation in education|Maharishi European Research University]] in the Netherlands, part of the [[Transcendental Meditation movement|TM movement]]. He also held visiting professorships at [[Wayne State University]] in 1983, the [[Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore]] in 1984, and the [[University of Missouri-Rolla]] in 1987.<ref>For Maharishi European Research University, see ''International Who's Who, 1983-84'', Europa Publications Limited, 1983, [http://books.google.com/books?id=_xJ4R0t9G3oC&q=Brian+Josephson p. 672].

==Parapsychology==
===Early interest, transcendental meditation===
{{further|Parapsychology|Quantum mind}}
[[File:TrinityCollegeCamGreatCourt.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=photograph|Josephson became a fellow of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] in 1962. The college has a history of interest in [[parapsychology]].]]
Josephson became interested in the late sixties in the [[mind–body problem]], and is one of the few scientists to argue that parapsychological phenomena  ([[telepathy]], [[psychokinesis]] and other paranormal themes) may be real.<ref>Alison George, [http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19225812.200-lone-voices-special-take-nobodys-word-for-it.html "Lone voices special: Take nobody's word for it"], ''New Scientist'', 9 December 2006 (pp. 56–57), p. 56.</ref> In 1971 he began practising [[transcendental meditation]] (TM), which had become popular with several celebrities, most famously the [[Beatles]].<ref>Bob Oates, ''Celebrating the Dawn: Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and the TM technique'', Putnam, 1976, p. 204: "'I learned the Transcendental Meditation Technique in 1971,' says Dr. Josephson."
*Emily J. McMurray, Jane Kelly Kosek, and Roger M. Valade, ''Notable Twentieth-Century Scientists'', Gale Research, 1995, p. 1044: "An important turning point in Josephson's life occurred in 1971, when he heard a radio announcement for a lecture on transcendental meditation (TM). He attended the lecture, became an adherent of TM, and has since become a student also of the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi."
*For celebrities and TM, see Lola Williamson, ''Transcendent in America'', NYU Press, 2010, p. 93.</ref>

Winning the Nobel Prize in 1973 gave him the freedom to work in less orthodox areas, and he became increasingly involved – including during science conferences, to the irritation of fellow scientists – in talking about meditation, telepathy and higher states of consciousness.<ref>Eliot Marshall, [http://www.jstor.org/stable/3084815 "For Winners, a New Life of Opportunity – and Perils"], ''Science'', 294(5541), 12 October 2001 (pp. 293, 295), p. 295.</ref> In 1974 he angered scientists during a colloquium of molecular and cellular biologists in Versailles by inviting them to read the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'' (5th – 2nd century BCE) and the work of [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]] (1918–2008), the founder of the TM movement, and by arguing about special states of consciousness achieved through meditation. "Nothing forces us," one scientist shouted at him, "to listen to your wild speculations." Biophysicist [[Henri Atlan]] wrote that the session ended in uproar.<ref>Henri Atlan, ''Enlightenment to Enlightenment: Intercritique of Science and Myth'', SUNY Press, 1993, [http://books.google.com/books?id=8p1cAi_aj5EC&pg=PA20 pp. 20–21].</ref>

Josephson became involved in the mid-seventies with a group of physicists associated with the [[Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], who were investigating paranormal claims. They had organized themselves loosely into something called the Fundamental Fysiks Group, and had effectively become the [[SRI International|Stanford Research Institute's]] (SRI) "house theorists," according to historian of science [[David Kaiser]]. There was a lot of popular and government interest at the time in quantum mechanics – the American government [[Stargate Project|was financing research]] at SRI into telepathy – and physicists able to understand it found themselves in demand. The Fundamental Fysiks Group used ideas from quantum physics, particularly [[Bell's theorem]] and [[quantum entanglement]], to explore issues such as [[action at a distance]], [[clairvoyance]], [[precognition]], [[remote viewing]] and [[psychokinesis]].<ref>David Kaiser, [http://shass.mit.edu/multimedia/video-2011-kaiser-how-hippies-saved-physics "How the Hippies Saved Physics"] (lecture), MIT School of Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences, 2010, from 20 mins; see from 23:20 mins for "house theorists", and from 28:40 mins for "house interpreters."</ref>

{{Quantum mechanics|cTopic=Fundamental concepts}}
In 1976 Josephson travelled to California to meet two leading members of the group, laser physicists [[Russell Targ]] and [[Harold E. Puthoff|Harold Puthoff]], authors of ''Mind Reach'' (1977). Targ and Puthoff had set up a parapsychology ("[[Psi (parapsychology)|psi]]") lab at SRI and had had papers published about their work – which included testing later-discredited claims by [[Uri Geller]] that he could make objects move using psychokinesis – in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' and other peer-reviewed journals. The ''San Francisco Chronicle'' covered Josephson's visit.<ref name=Kaiser2011p144>David Kaiser, ''How the Hippies Saved Physics: Science, Counterculture, and the Quantum Revival'', W. W.

===Reception, views on science===
Josephson delivered the Pollock Memorial Lecture in 2006, the [[Hermann Staudinger]] Lecture in 2009 and the Sir [[Nevill Francis Mott|Nevill Mott]] Lecture in 2010.<ref>[http://nsw.royalsoc.org.au/awards/pollock.htm "The Pollock Memorial Lecture"], The Royal Society of New South Wales and the University of Sydney; [http://www.frias.uni-freiburg.de/de/veranstaltungen/staudinger-lectures/staudinger-josephson "4th Hermann Staudinger Lecture with Nobel Laureate Brian D.

Matthew Reisz wrote in ''Times Higher Education'' in 2010 that Josephson has long been one of physics's "more colourful figures."<ref>Matthew Reisz, [http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=411401 "He didn't see that coming, or did he?"], ''Times Higher Education'', 19 April 2010.

Park]], ''Superstition: Belief in the Age of Science'', Princeton University Press, 2009, p. 156.</ref> Josephson regards the criticism as prejudice, and believes that it has served to deprive him of an academic support network.<ref>[http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19225812.200-lone-voices-special-take-nobodys-word-for-it.html George (''New Scientist'') 2006], p. 57.</ref>

He has repeatedly criticized "science by consensus," arguing that the scientific community is too quick to reject certain kinds of ideas. "Anything goes among the physics community – cosmic wormholes, time travel," he argues, "just so long as it keeps its distance from anything mystical or New Age-ish." Referring to this position as "pathological disbelief," he holds it responsible for the rejection by academic journals of papers on the paranormal.<ref>[http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19225812.200-lone-voices-special-take-nobodys-word-for-it.html George (''New Scientist'') 2006], p. 56; Brian Josephson, [http://www.lenr-canr.org/acrobat/JosephsonBpathologic.pdf "Pathological Disbelief"], lecture, Nobel Laureates' meeting, Lindau, 30 June 2004.</ref> He has compared parapsychology to the theory of [[continental drift]], proposed in 1912 by [[Alfred Wegener]] (1880–1930) to explain observations that were otherwise inexplicable, which was resisted and ridiculed until evidence led to its acceptance after Wegener's death.<ref>Josephson 2005, [http://books.google.com/books?id=YxDddIkpmnYC&pg=PA1 pp. 1–2]; for Wegener, also see J. W. Grove, [http://www.jstor.org/stable/41820616 "Rationality at Risk: Science against Pseudoscience"], ''Minerva'', 23(2), June 1985 (pp. 216–240), p. 218.</ref>

Science writer [[Martin Gardner]] (1914–2010) criticized Josephson in 1980 for complaining to the ''New York Review of Books'', along with three other physicists, about an article by [[John Archibald Wheeler|J. A. Wheeler]] (1911–2008) that ridiculed parapsychology.<ref>Olivier Costa de Beauregard, Richard D. Mattuck, Brian D. Josephson and Evan Harris Walker, [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1980/jun/26/parapsychology-an-exchange/ "Parapsychology: An Exchange"], ''New York Review of Books'', 27, 26 June 1980, pp. 48–51. The other three physicists were [[Evan Harris Walker]] (1935–2006), [[Olivier Costa de Beauregard]] (1911–2007) and Richard D. Mattuck.</ref> Several physicists complained in 2001 when, in a [[Royal Mail]] booklet celebrating the Nobel Prize's centenary, Josephson wrote that Britain was at the forefront of research into telepathy.<ref>Brian Josephson, [http://www.tcm.phy.cam.ac.uk/~bdj10/stamps/text.html "Physics and the Nobel Prizes"], Royal Mail, 2001: "Physicists attempt to reduce the complexity of nature to a single unifying theory, of which the most successful and universal, the quantum theory, has been associated with several Nobel prizes, for example those to Dirac and Heisenberg. Max Planck's original attempts a hundred years ago to explain the precise amount of energy radiated by hot bodies began a process of capturing in mathematical form a mysterious, elusive world containing 'spooky interactions at a distance', real enough however to lead to inventions such as the laser and transistor.<p>Quantum theory is now being fruitfully combined with theories of information and computation. These developments may lead to an explanation of processes still not understood within conventional science such as telepathy, an area where Britain is at the forefront of research.</ref> Physicist [[David Deutsch]] said the Royal Mail had "let itself be hoodwinked" into supporting nonsense, although another physicist, [[Robert Matthews (scientist)|Robert Matthews]], suggested that Deutsch was skating on thin ice given the latter's own work on [[Many-worlds interpretation|parallel universe]]s and [[Quantum mechanics of time travel|time travel]].<ref>David McKie, [http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/sep/30/robinmckie.theobserver "Royal Mail's Nobel guru in telepathy row"], ''The Observer'', 30 September 2001; Robert Matthews, [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/4767204/Time-travel.html "Time Travel"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 8 November 2001.</ref>

In 2004 Josephson criticized an experiment by the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] to test claims by Russian schoolgirl [[Natasha Demkina]] that she could see inside people's bodies using a special kind of vision. The experiment involved her being asked to match six people to their confirmed medical conditions (plus one with none); to pass the test she had to make five correct matches, but made only four.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36GQou1gBGM "Body Shock: The Girl With X-Ray Eyes"], Discovery Channel, 2004 (for a display from Demkina's perspective, see [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-si-E6rV0 part 2], from 04:00 mins; for the second, more controlled, experiment, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-si-E6rV0 part 2], from 10:30 mins and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYVCnN0JcsY part 3]).

Skolnick]], [http://www.livescience.com/109-natasha-demkina-girl-normal-eyes.html "Natasha Demkina: The Girl with Very Normal Eyes"], ''LiveScience'', 28 January 2005.</ref> Josephson argued that this was statistically significant and that the experiment had set her up to fail. One of the researchers, [[Richard Wiseman]], professor of psychology at the [[University of Hertfordshire]], responded that Josephson had no record of publishing on parapsychology.<ref>Phil Baty, [http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/scientists-fail-to-see-eye-to-eye-over-girls-x-ray-vision/192922.article "Scientists fail to see eye to eye over girl's 'X-ray vision'"], ''Times Higher Education'', 10 December 2004.

Josephson's reputation for promoting unorthodox causes was cemented by his support for the ideas of [[water memory]] and [[cold fusion]], both of which are rejected by mainstream scientists. Water memory is purported to provide an explanation for [[homeopathy]]; it is mostly dismissed by scientists as [[pseudoscience]], although Josephson has expressed support for it since attending a conference at which French immunologist [[Jacques Benveniste]] (1935–2004) first proposed it.<ref>[http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19225812.200-lone-voices-special-take-nobodys-word-for-it.html George (''New Scientist'') 2006], p. 56.

Following the death of [[Martin Fleischmann]] (1927–2012), the British chemist who pioneered research into it, Josephson wrote a supportive obituary in the ''Guardian'' and complained to ''Nature'' that its obituary had failed to give Fleischmann due credit.<ref>Brian Josephson, [http://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/aug/31/martin-fleischmann "Martin Fleischmann obituary"], ''The Guardian'', 31 August 2012.
