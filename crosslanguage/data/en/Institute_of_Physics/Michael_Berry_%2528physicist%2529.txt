'''Sir Michael Victor Berry''', [[Royal Society|FRS]] (born 14 March 1941), is a [[Mathematical physics|mathematical physicist]] at the [[University of Bristol]], [[England]].

He was elected a fellow of the [[Royal Society of London]] in 1982 and knighted in 1996.  From 2006 he has been editor of the journal, [[Proceedings of the Royal Society]].

He is famous for the [[Geometric phase|Berry phase]], a phenomenon observed e.g. in [[quantum mechanics]] and [[optics]].  He specialises in semiclassical physics (asymptotic physics, [[quantum chaos]]), applied to wave phenomena in [[quantum mechanics]] and other areas such as [[optics]]. He is also currently affiliated with the Institute for Quantum Studies at [[Chapman University]] in California.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chapman.edu/research-and-institutions/quantum-studies/members.aspx|title=Members, Institute of Quantum Studies|publisher=Chapman University|accessdate=2014-03-01}}</ref>
