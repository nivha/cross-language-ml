He joined the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Strathclyde in September 2004. His research interests centre on trajectory and mission analysis for solar sails, autonomous spacecraft control and space robotics. He is a fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society, the Royal Society of Edinburgh and was elected a fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering in July 2003.

He is currently a director of research at the [[University of Strathclyde]].
