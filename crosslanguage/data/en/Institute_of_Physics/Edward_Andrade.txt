'''Edward Neville da Costa Andrade''' [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]]<ref name="frs">{{cite doi|10.1098/rsbm.1972.0001}}</ref> (27 December 1887 – 6 June 1971) was an [[England|English]] [[physicist]], writer, and poet. He told ''The [[Literary Digest]]'' his name was pronounced "as written, i.e., like ''air raid'', with ''and'' substituted for ''air''." <ref>Charles Earle Funk, ''What's the Name, Please?'', Funk & Wagnalls, 1936.</ref> He is best known for work (with [[Ernest Rutherford]]) that first determined the wavelength of a type of [[gamma radiation]].

==Background==
Edward Neville Andrade was a [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi Jew]] and was a descendant of [[Moses da Costa Andrade]] (not [[Moses da Costa]] as is sometimes stated). Moses da Costa Andrade was his 2nd great grandfather, a feather merchant in London's East End.

Edward Neville studied for a doctorate at the [[University of Heidelberg]] and then had a brief but productive spell of research with [[Ernest Rutherford, 1st Baron Rutherford of Nelson|Ernest Rutherford]] at [[Manchester]] in 1914. They carried out experiments to determine the wavelengths of [[gamma-ray]]s from radium, and were the first to be able to quantitate these, thereby showing that they were shorter than the wavelengths of then-known X-ray radiation that was produced by "Roentgen tubes".<ref>Andrade, E.N. da C. "Personal Reminiscences." http://www.iucr.org/__data/assets/pdf_file/0014/743/andrade.pdf</ref><ref>Rutherford, Ernest. “The Natural and Artificial Disintegration of the Elements.” ''The Scientific Monthly'', Vol. 19, No. 6 (Dec., 1924), pp. 561-578.</ref> He joined the [[Royal Artillery]] during the [[First World War]], and then became Professor of Physics at the Ordnance College in Woolwich in 1920.

==Career==
He was [[Quain Professor]] of Physics at [[University College, London]] from 1928 to 1950, and then Fullerian Professor of Chemistry at the [[Royal Institution]] for three years,<ref>[http://www.johnmadjackfuller.homestead.com/fullerianprofessors.html Fullerian Professorships]</ref> until opposition to his attempts to reform the RI led to a vote of no confidence in him by members of the RI, following which he resigned. In 1943 Andrade was invited to deliver the [[Royal Institution Christmas Lectures]] on ''Vibrations and Waves'', then in 1950 he developed the lectures further and presented the series on ''Waves and Vibrations''.

Andrade was also a broadcaster, appearing on [[BBC]] radio's ''[[The Brains Trust]]''.
