The '''''Journal of Physics B: Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics''''' is a [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[scientific journal]] published biweekly by [[IOP Publishing]]. It was established in 1968 from the division of the earlier title, ''Physical Society (London) Proceedings''. In 2006, the ''[[Journal of Optics B|Journal of Optics B: Quantum and Semiclassical Optics]]'' was merged with the ''Journal of Physics B''. The editor-in-chief is [[Paul Corkum]] (University of Ottawa-NRC, Canada).

==Scope==
The journal covers research on [[atomic physics|atomic]], [[molecular physics]] and [[optical physics]] which is known by researchers in the field as "AMO physics". Topics include  atomic and molecular structure, spectra and collisions, ultracold matter, [[quantum optics]] and non linear optics, [[quantum information]], laser physics, intense laser fields, ultrafast and x-ray physics and atomic and molecular physics in plasmas. 

The journal publishes research papers, Fast Track Communications (FTCs), topical reviews, tutorials and invited articles. It publishes Special Issues on developing research fields.
