}}'''George Ingle Finch''', [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]]<ref name="frs"/> (4 August 1888&nbsp;– 22 November 1970) was a chemist and mountaineer.<ref>{{cite jstor|1795428}}</ref><ref name="odnb">{{cite doi|10.1093/ref:odnb/33130 }}</ref><ref>{{cite doi|10.1580/09-WEME-BK-343.1}}</ref>

==Education==

He was born in Australia but educated in German-speaking Switzerland and studied physical sciences at [[University of Geneva]].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

==Career==
A member of the [[British Mount Everest Expedition 1922|second British expedition]] under General [[Charles Granville Bruce]] to [[Mount Everest]], on 23 May 1922 Finch and Captain C. Geoffrey Bruce reached an altitude of 27,300 feet (8,321 m) on the north ridge before retreating.<ref>[http://www.everestnews2004.com/malloryandirvine2004/stories2004/bruce.htm Capt. C. Geoffrey Bruce]</ref> Finch fell out with the Everest Committee after 1922, but his pioneering work on oxygen, which he pursued with messianic zeal, remained crucial to future expeditions. In the [[Alps]], Finch was on the [[first ascent]] of the North Face Diagonal or 'Finch Route' on the [[Dent d'Hérens]], which he climbed with T. G. B. Forster and R. Peto on 2 August 1923. Finch was also a keen skier and was a founding members of the [[Alpine Ski Club]] in 1908. He was a lifelong advocate and supporter of the [[Alpine Club (UK)|Alpine Club]] and would later become its president.

Between 1936 and 1952 he held the position of Professor of Applied Physical Chemistry at [[Imperial College London]].

He was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]]<ref name="frs"/> in 1938. His candidacy citation read {{quote|text="Distinguished for his knowledge of Chemical Physics and Electrochemistry, and particularly for his researches upon the electrical conditions and structure of catalytic surfaces, the mechanism of ignition and combustion in electrical discharges, and upon electron diffraction and its applications to the study of surface structure. His outstanding skill in the design of instruments and experimental methods has enabled him greatly to increase the accuracy of measurements in connection with electron diffraction and cathode-ray oscillography. The result of his researches have been published in some 50 papers, including many in the Society's Proceedings."<ref name="royal">{{cite web|url=http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=Show.tcl&dsqDb=Persons&dsqPos=2&dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27finch%27%29|title = Library and Archive Catalogue|publisher=The Royal Society|accessdate=14 December 2010|location=London}}</ref>}}

Finch was awarded their [[Hughes Medal]] in 1944.  He was president of the [[Physical Society]] from 1947 to 1949.

==Personal life==
Finch raised Oscar winning film actor, [[Peter Finch]] as his own son, even though he was not the biological father. The child was the result of Finch's wife's affair with an injured military officer while Finch was abroad fighting in World War I.<ref>[http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/finch-frederick-george-peter-ingle-10179 "Finch, Frederick George Peter Ingle (1916–1977)"].
