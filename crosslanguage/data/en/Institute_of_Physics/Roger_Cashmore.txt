==Controversy==
Cashmore's final years at Oxford were marked by allegations of improper claims for travel expenses, following the publication in May 2010 of a leaked report from an investigation committee at Brasenose College.<ref name='CherwellExp'>{{cite news | first = Camilla | last = Turner | title = Brasenose head in expenses leak | date = 2010-05-27 | publisher = [[Oxford Student Publications Limited]] | url = http://www.cherwell.org/news/2010/05/27/brasenose-head-in-expenses-leak | work = [[Cherwell (newspaper)|Cherwell]] | accessdate = 2011-10-27 | quote = Report claims unauthorised foreign trips for Professor Cashmore and his wife}}</ref><ref name='TelegraphExp'>{{cite news | first = Stephen | last = Adams | coauthors = Camilla Turner | title = Oxford principal faced travel expenses investigation | date = 2010-05-31 | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/journalists/stephen-adams/7786330/Oxford-principal-faced-travel-expenses-investigation.html | work = [[The Daily Telegraph]] | accessdate = 2011-10-27 | quote = An Oxford University college principal has been investigated over his travel expenses for a string of trips to Pakistan, north America and Greece.}}</ref>  Cashmore denied any misuse of expenses, claiming that the report contained a number of inaccuracies.<ref name='TelegraphExp'/>  During October 2010 Brasenose College announced that Cashmore would be taking research leave.<ref name='TelegraphLeave'>{{cite news | first = Graeme | last = Paton | coauthors = Camilla Turner | title = Expenses row Oxford don takes study leave | date = 2010-10-06 | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/8046359/Expenses-row-Oxford-don-takes-study-leave.html | work = [[The Daily Telegraph]] | accessdate = 2011-10-27 | quote = An Oxford University college principal has taken a year-long sabbatical after being investigated over his travel expenses.}}</ref>  The college denied that there was any link between this decision and the previous allegations concerning expenses, but a second leaked document indicated that the Governing Body of the College had passed a motion of no confidence in Cashmore,<ref name='TelegraphLeave'/><ref name='CherwellCash'>{{cite news | first = Camilla | last = Turner | title = Even more cash for Cashmore | date = 2010-10-15 | publisher = [[Oxford Student Publications Limited]] | url = http://www.cherwell.org/news/2010/10/09/even-more-cash-for-cashmore | work = [[Cherwell (newspaper)|Cherwell]] | accessdate = 2011-10-27 | quote = Brasenose Principal will be paid £1250 per day for a post advertised just two days after expenses scandal}}</ref> who subsequently applied for the post of chairman of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority.<ref name='CherwellCash'/><ref name='CherwellWhat'>{{cite news | title = The week that was: Cash for Cashmore | date = 2010-10-14 | publisher = [[Oxford Student Publications Limited]] | url = http://www.cherwell.org/comment/2010/10/15/the-week-that-was-cash-for-cashmore | work = [[Cherwell (newspaper)|Cherwell]] | accessdate = 2011-10-27}}</ref> A spokesperson for Brasenose College said "The members of the standing Sub-Committee were dismayed that their report to the Governing Body had been leaked to the press."<ref name='CherwellCash'/>  The college also commented that "The [expenses] report did not conclude that the Principal had submitted any claims for travel expenses that were not genuine.

On 9 December 2010 Brasenose's Acting Principal [[Alan Bowman]] announced Professor Cashmore's retirement from his role as Principal at the end of the 2010-2011 academic year "to focus on his role as Chairman of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority and to return to his research interests at CERN and the LHC (Large Hadron Collider), at what is a particularly exciting time for particle physics." <ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bnc.ox.ac.uk/288/about-brasenose-31/news-152/retirement-of-the-principal-professor-cashmore-872.html | title = Retirement of the Principal, Professor Cashmore | date = December 9, 2010 | publisher = [[Brasenose College, Oxford]] }}</ref>  This announcement led to the republication of previous allegations.<ref name='CherwellRetire'>{{cite news | first = Joanna | last = Wall | title = Brasenose Principal to retire | date = 2010-12-17 | publisher = [[Oxford Student Publications Limited]] | url = http://www.cherwell.org/news-in-brief/2010/12/13/brasenose-principal-to-retire | work = [[Cherwell (newspaper)|Cherwell]] | accessdate = 2011-10-27 | quote = Cashmore set to retire after expenses revelations in Cherwell }}</ref><ref name='OxStuLeave'>{{cite news | title = Cashmore says goodbye to Brasenose | date = 2011-01-14 | publisher = [[Oxford University Student Union]] | url = http://oxfordstudent.com/2011/01/14/cashmore-says-goodbye-to-brasenose/ | work = [[The Oxford Student]] | accessdate = 2011-10-27 | quote = Brasenose College has announced that their Principal Professor Roger Cashmore will be retiring at the end of this academic year (September 2011) in order to focus on his role as Chairman of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority.}}</ref><ref name='CherwellLeave'>{{cite news | first = Joanna | last = Wall | coauthors = Camilla Turner | title = Cashmore to retire early | date = 2011-01-14 | publisher = [[Oxford Student Publications Limited]] | url = http://www.cherwell.org/news/2011/01/14/cashmore-to-retire-early | work = [[Cherwell (newspaper)|Cherwell]] | accessdate = 2011-10-27 | quote = Brasenose Principal set to leave following expenses leak}}</ref>
