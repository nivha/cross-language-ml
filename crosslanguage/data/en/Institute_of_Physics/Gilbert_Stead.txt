He retired from Guy's Hospital in 1953.<ref>''The Times'' Monday, July 27, 1953; pg. 8;</ref>

Stead wrote the text ''Elementary Physics'', which, when it was published in 1924, was "hailed as a superb source of help to struggling radiology and medical students."<ref>Haggith, J.W. (1983) ''History of the Hospital Physicists Association 1943-1983'', Hospital Physicists' Association, p. 130.</ref>  This text was continuously in print, published in updated editions, for over 50 years. In 1939, he wrote the book ''Notes in Practical Physics'' which was widely used in British schools.
