The '''''Journal of Optics''''' is a [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[scientific journal]] covering all aspects of modern and classical [[optics]], experimental and theoretical studies, applications and [[instrumentation]]. It is the official journal of the [[European Optical Society]] and is published by [[IOP Publishing]]. The [[editor-in-chief]] is [[Nikolay I. Zheludev]] ([[University of Southampton]]). According to the ''[[Journal Citation Reports]]'', the journal has a 2012 [[impact factor]] of 1.990.<ref name=WoS>{{cite book |year=2013 |chapter=Journal of Optics |title=2012 [[Journal Citation Reports]] |publisher=[[Thomson Reuters]] |edition=Science |series=[[Web of Science]] |postscript=.}}</ref>

==History==
The journal was established in 1912 as the ''Revue Générale d’Optique et de Mécanique de Précision''. Publication was suspended during the [[First World War]] and only resumed in 1921, when the name was shortened to ''Revue d'Optique''. Due to the [[Second World War]], publication was again suspended in 1944, but resumed in 1947. After another suspension in 1968, the journal re-appeared in 1970 as the ''Nouvelle Revue d'Optique Appliquée''. In 1977 it was renamed ''Journal of Optics''.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Howard |first=J. N. |year=2005 |title=The History of a Journal: How the ''Revue d’Optique'' Became the ''Journal of Optics'' |url=http://www.osa-opn.org/Content/ViewFile.aspx?id=7032 |journal=[[Optics & Photonics News]] |volume=16 |issue=4 |page=12–13 |bibcode= |doi=}}</ref> in 1998 it merged with ''[[Pure and Applied Optics|Pure and Applied Optics: Journal of the European Optical Society Part A]]'' and was renamed ''Journal of Optics A: Pure and Applied Optics''. As part of the merger the other publication of the European Optical Society, ''[[Quantum and Semiclassical Optics|Quantum and Semiclassical Optics: Journal of the European Optical Society Part B]]'', was renamed ''Journal of Optics B: Quantum and Semiclassical Optics''.

In 2006, ''Journal of Optics B'' was merged into ''[[Journal of Physics B: Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics]]''. ''Journal of Optics A'' was renamed ''Journal of Optics'' in January 2010,<ref>
