'''Sir Charles Galton Darwin''', [[Order of the British Empire|KBE]], [[Military Cross|MC]], [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]]<ref name="frs">{{cite doi|10.1098/rsbm.1963.0004}}</ref> (18 December 1887 &ndash; 31 December 1962) was an [[England|English]] [[physicist]], the grandson of [[Charles Darwin]]. He served as director of the [[National Physical Laboratory, UK|National Physical Laboratory]] (NPL) during the [[Second World War]].<ref name="mactutor">{{MacTutor Biography|id=Darwin_C_G}}</ref>

==Early life==
Darwin was born in [[Cambridge]], England into a scientific dynasty, the son of the [[mathematician]] Sir [[George Howard Darwin]] and the grandson of Charles Darwin.  His mother was Lady Darwin, [[Maud du Puy]] of [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]].  His elder sister was the artist [[Gwen Raverat]], and his younger sister Margaret married [[Geoffrey Keynes]], the brother of the economist [[John Maynard Keynes]]. His younger brother William Robert Darwin was a London stockbroker. Darwin was educated at [[Marlborough College]] and, in 1910, he graduated from [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] in [[mathematics]].

==Career==
He secured a post-graduate position at the [[Victoria University of Manchester]], working under [[Ernest Rutherford]] and [[Niels Bohr]] on Rutherford's [[atom]]ic theory. In 1912, his interests developed into using his mathematical skills assisting [[Henry Moseley]] on [[X-ray]] [[diffraction]]. His two 1914 papers on diffraction of X-rays from perfect crystals became often cited classics.

On the outbreak of [[World War I]], he was commissioned and sent to France as a censor. A year later [[William Lawrence Bragg]] had him transferred to the [[Royal Engineers]] to participate in the work on the localization of enemy artillery by sound ranging.<ref>Van der Kloot,W. (2005). "Lawrence Bragg's role in the development of sound-ranging in World War I." ''Notes Rec. R. Soc. Lond''. '''59''': 273-284.</ref>  When that was on a sound footing he was transferred to the RAF to study airplane noise. From  1919 to 1922 he was a lecturer and fellow of [[Christ's College, Cambridge]] where he worked with [[R.H. Fowler]] on [[statistical mechanics]] and, what came to be known as, the ''Darwin–Fowler method''. He then worked for a year at the [[California Institute of Technology]] before becoming Tait Professor of [[Natural Philosophy]] at the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 1924, working on [[quantum optics]] and [[magneto-optic]] effects. He was the first in 1928, to calculate the fine structure of the hydrogen atom under  [[P.A.M. Dirac]]'s [[theory of relativity|relativistic]] theory of the [[electron]].

In 1936 Darwin became master of Christ's College, beginning his career as an active and able administrator, becoming director of the [[National Physical Laboratory, UK|National Physical Laboratory]] on the approach of war in 1938. He served in the role into the post-war period, unafraid to seek improved laboratory performance through re-organisation, but spending much of the war years working on the [[Manhattan Project]] coordinating the American, British, and Canadian efforts.

He was appointed [[KBE]] in 1942; he was cremated at Cambridge Crematorium on January 4, 1963. He and his late wife are commemorated with a memorial at St. Botolph's Church, Cambridge.

==Private life==
In 1925 he married [[Katharine Pember]], a mathematician and daughter of [[Francis William Pember]].  They had four sons and a daughter:
* Cecily Darwin (born 1926) became an [[X-ray crystallography|X-ray crystallographer]] and in 1951 married John Littleton of Philadelphia.
* [[George Pember Darwin]] (1928–2001) worked [[computer science|developing computers]], and then (1964) married Angela Huxley, daughter of [[David Bruce Huxley]].  She was also a granddaughter of the writer [[Leonard Huxley (writer)|Leonard Huxley]] and a great-granddaughter of [[Thomas Huxley]], "Darwin's Bulldog".
* [[Henry Galton Darwin]] (1929–1992) was with the British [[Foreign Office]], and married Jane Christie.
* Francis William Darwin (1932–2001) was a [[Zoology|zoologist]] and taught at the [[University of London]], and married in 1974.
* [[Edward Leonard Darwin]] (born 1934) became a [[civil engineering|civil engineer]].

In his spare time, Darwin also served as a wartime vice-president of the [[Simplified Spelling Society]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.spellingsociety.org/journals/pamflets/officers.php | title=The Simplified Spelling Society Officers and Committee Members | publisher=The Spelling Society | accessdate=2009-05-27 }}</ref>

On his retirement, his attention turned to issues of [[population]], [[genetics]] and [[eugenics]]. His conclusions were [[pessimism|pessimistic]] and entailed a resigned belief in an inevitable [[Malthusian catastrophe]], as described in his 1952 book ''The Next Million Years''. He first argued in this book that voluntary birth control (family planning) establishes a selective system that ensures its own failure. The cause is that people with the strongest instinct for wanting children will have the largest families and they will hand on the instinct to their children, while those with weaker instincts will have smaller families and will hand on that instinct to their children. In the long run society will consist mainly of people with the strongest instinct to reproduce. This would ultimately have dysgeneic effects.<ref>Carl Jay Bajema (ed) ''Eugenics. Then and Now'', Dowden, Hutchinson, & Ross Inc. , 1976, p. 294-298.</ref>

In later years he travelled widely, an enthusiastic collaborator across national borders and an able communicator of scientific ideas. He died in Cambridge and is buried in St Botolph Church's [[Mill Road Cemetery]], Cambridge.
