==Career==
Rankine carried out government research during both World Wars, working on anti-submarine technology and on [[Fog Investigation and Dispersal Operation (FIDO)|fog dispersal systems]]. He studied and worked at [[University College London]], and was a professor of physics at [[Imperial College London]].

Rankine is most associated with the [[Trouton–Rankine experiment]] of 1908, but he also worked on early devices for the optical transmission of sound, and improved [[gravimeter]] and [[magnetometer]] designs. The latter part of his career was spent working for the [[Anglo-Iranian Oil Company]]. He also served in a range of positions with many learned societies, including periods as President of the [[Physical Society]] and Secretary to the [[Royal Institution]].

==Early years==
Alexander Oliver Rankine was born on 8 December 1881 in [[Guildford]], Surrey, England.<ref name="The Times">Obituary: Professor A. O. Rankine, ''The Times'', Saturday, Jan 21, 1956; pg. 9; Issue 53434; col A</ref><ref>The birthdate is given in the Library and Archive catalogue Fellows' entry for Rankine at The Royal Society.</ref> The son of the Reverend John Rankine, a [[Baptist]] minister of Scottish descent,<ref name="frs"/> Alexander was brought up in and was a member of the Baptist Church.<ref name="CDSB">[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-2830903582.html Rankine, Alexander Oliver], Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography. 2008. Retrieved April 17, 2011 from Encyclopedia.com</ref> Like his father, his mother was also of Scottish ancestry.<ref name="frs"/>

Rankine was educated at the [[Royal Grammar School, Guildford]],<ref name="The Times"/> and then studied at [[University College London]] (UCL), graduating in 1904 with first-class honours in physics.<ref name="The Times"/> Following graduation, he worked as an assistant in the UCL physics department from 1904, a position he would remain in until 1919 apart from a period spent doing wartime research.<ref name="frs"/> In 1907, he married Ruby Irene Short, with whom he would have two sons and two daughters.<ref name="The Times"/>

==University College and World War I==
During this period at UCL, Rankine worked under the Irish physicist [[Frederick Thomas Trouton]].<ref name="CDSB"/> In 1908, he and Trouton carried out what become known as the [[Trouton–Rankine experiment]].<ref>{{cite doi| 10.1098/rspa.1908.0037 |noedit}}</ref> This experiment was among a number being carried out at the time, and was intended as a test of [[aether theory]] and Einstein's [[special relativity]], with Trouton and Rankine's null result providing support for the latter theory.

Two years later, in 1910, Rankine obtained his [[D.Sc]] in Physics (awarded by the University of London).<ref name="The Times"/><ref>''The historical record (1836-1912) being a supplement to the Calendar completed to September 1912'', University of London, Hodder & Stoughton, 1912</ref> A further two years after that, in 1912, he was elected a fellow of University College.<ref name="The Times"/> His research in this period was on the viscosity of gases, and he invented a [[viscosimeter]] (the ''Rankine viscosimeter''), enabling him to carry out experimental determinations of the ''Sutherland constant'' (described by [[William Sutherland (physicist)|William Sutherland]]).<ref name="CDSB"/> The aim of this work was to produce estimates of the size and shape of gas molecules, and Rankine's results in this area were published between 1910 and 1926.<ref name="CDSB"/> While at UCL, Rankine also served twice as President of 'The Chemical and Physical Society' (ChemPhysSoc), the students' society of the chemistry and physics departments, doing so in the years 1910-11 and 1915-16.<ref>[http://www.chem.ucl.ac.uk/resources/history/cpspres.html History - Past ChemPhysSoc Presidents], History of UCL, University College London, accessed 19/04/2011</ref>

During World War I, many scientists were seconded to carry out wartime research for the government. Rankine's wartime research  took place in 1917 and 1918, and he worked under recently appointed UCL professor [[William Henry Bragg]] and British-born Canadian physicist [[Arthur Stewart Eve]].<ref name="frs"/> Rankine worked first at [[Aberdour]] on the Firth of Forth in Scotland, then at the [[Harwich]] research station, both as part of work by the [[Admiralty Research Laboratory]].<ref name="frs"/> His final posting was as Director of the research station at [[Kingswear]].<ref name="frs"/> Rankine's work during this period included developing submarine detection technology.<ref name="frs"/>

Rankine's research during and immediately after the war also looked at ways to achieve the optical transmission of sound, a problem being worked on by other scientists and engineers in several countries.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1117/12.330481|noedit}}</ref> The device was similar to the [[photophone]] constructed by US inventor [[Alexander Graham Bell]] in the 1880s, and the system being developed by the Polish engineer [[Joseph Tykociński-Tykociner]] from 1918. Rankine's work in this area was mentioned in ''[[Popular Science]]'' in 1922,<ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bioDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA29 Will America or England Win Race to Make Movies Talk?], ''Popular Science'', October 1922, p.29</ref> and has been described as an "effective technique for the transmission of speech by sunlight".<ref name="Imperial College Optics">[http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/photonics/about/history/fullhistory A History of Optics at Imperial College London], Imperial College London, accessed 19/04/2011</ref>

For his government research work during World War I, Rankine was made an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire|OBE]] in 1919.<ref name="frs"/><ref>The award year of 1919 is noted by the Library and Archive catalogue Fellows' entry for Rankine at The Royal Society. The award, along with many others made for work done during the war, was gazetted in the [http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/31114/supplements/458 Supplement to the London Gazette, of 8 January 1919].</ref>

==Imperial College and geophysics==
By the time the war had ended, Rankine had added to the distinguished reputation he had gained from work in fields such as [[molecular dynamics]], [[acoustics]] and [[electromagnetics]].<ref name="Imperial College Optics"/> In 1919, he was appointed Professor of Physics at [[Imperial College]], succeeding to the position held by [[Lord Rayleigh]].<ref name="frs"/> It was around this time that Rankine wrote for the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] under the initials AOR (1922 edition), contributing the article on 'Sound'<ref>''The Encyclopædia Britannica: the new volumes, constituting, in combination with the twenty-nine volumes of the eleventh edition, the twelfth edition of that work, and also supplying a new, distinctive, and independent library of reference dealing with events and developments of the period 1910 to 1921 inclusive'', Volume 3, Hugh Chisholm (1922)</ref>

From 1925 to 1931, Rankine was additionally Director of the Technical Optics Department at Imperial College.<ref name="frs"/><ref name="Imperial College Optics"/><ref name="Who's Who">[http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whowaswho/U242124 Rankine, Alexander Oliver], Who Was Who, A & C Black, 1920–2008; online edn, Oxford University Press, Dec 2007, accessed 18 April 2011</ref> He was the second holder of this post, succeeding Frederic John Cheshire, and the department name was changed at his request (it had previously been the Optical Design Department).<ref name="Imperial College Optics"/> From 1931 onwards, Rankine was again solely Professor of Physics following the merger of the Technical Optics Department with the Physics Department,<ref name="frs"/> with Louis Claude Martin taking over as leader of what was now a postgraduate section (and today is the [[photonics]] section).<ref name="Imperial College Optics"/>

These changes mirrored Rankine's shift in interests from optics to the newly emerging field of [[geophysics]]. His interest in this area developed in the late 1920s and early 1930s, and from 1927 onwards he become an advisor for the [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company]] (later the Anglo-Iran Oil Company, and later still British Petroleum).<ref name="frs"/><ref name="The Times"/> It was in 1934 that the School of Applied Geophysics was established at Imperial College, with Rankine directing the research.<ref name="IC History">[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=x4u4ikoj1M8C The history of Imperial College London, 1907-2007], Hannah Gay, World Scientific, 2007</ref> His work in this area included improving the gravimeter invented by [[Loránd Eötvös]] (the ''Eötvös gravimeter'') and constructing a [[magnetometer]] "of great sensitivity".<ref name="CDSB"/>

In 1937, Rankine resigned from Imperial College to take up a full-time position with the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company,<ref>{{cite doi|10.1038/139830b0}}</ref> in which role he made several visits to Persia (Iran).<ref name="frs"/> This resignation was marked by the following rhyme, published in 1937 in ''The Record'' of the [[Royal College of Science Association]]:<blockquote>If Rankine prefers travel<br>To academic toil,<br>No one of us will cavil,<br>At the fact that he's struck oil.<ref name="IC History"/></blockquote> On his departure, Rankine became Emeritus Professor of Physics at Imperial College, holding that title from 1937 to his death.<ref name="The Times"/>

==Learned and professional societies==
During his career, Rankine was "an active member of several professional societies" and "held various honorary positions throughout his life".<ref name="CDSB"/> In 1925 he was elected a member of the [[Royal Institution]].<ref>''Notices of the proceedings at the meetings of the members of the Royal Institution, with abstracts of the discourses'', Volume 24, 1925, page 86</ref> He was also involved with the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] (BAAS), serving as the Recorder for Section A (Mathematics and Physics) from 1921 to 1924, and President of Section A in 1932.<ref name="Who's Who"/> He was Honorary Secretary of both the [[Physical Society]] (1923–29) and the [[Institute of Physics]] (1926–31).<ref name="Who's Who"/> He also served as President of the [[Optical Society]] (1931–32) and the Physical Society (1932–1934),<ref name="Who's Who"/> both of these organisations later merging with the Institute of Physics.

One of the final positions he held was Secretary to the Royal Institution (1945–1953).<ref name="RIGB2">[http://www.rigb.org/contentControl?action=displayContent&id=00000003056 RI Secretaries since 1799], The Royal Institution of Great Britain, accessed 18/04/2011</ref> It was in this role that he became a key player in the opposition to the Andrade reforms, a power struggle that led to a 1952 vote of no confidence in [[Edward Andrade]] as Director of the Royal Institution.<ref name="RIGB">[http://www.rigb.org/contentControl?action=displayContent&id=00000000036 Alexander Oliver Rankine (1881-1956)], The Royal Institution of Great Britain, accessed 18/04/2011</ref>

==Awards and honours==
As well as his [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]], Rankine was accorded other honours for his work. These included being asked to present the 1932 [[Royal Institution Christmas Lectures|Royal Institution Christmas Lecture]], which he gave under the title: 'The Round of the Waters'.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1038/130960d0|noedit}}</ref> In 1934 he was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]].<ref name="The Times"/> He was also made the [[Faraday Medal and Prize|Guthrie Lecturer]] in 1949, delivering the 33rd Guthrie Lecture on 19 March 1949, titled 'Experimental Studies in Thermal Convection'.<ref>{{cite doi| 10.1088/0370-1298/63/5/301|noedit}}</ref><ref>{{cite doi|10.1038/163438c0|noedit}}</ref>

==World War II and later years==
During World War II, Rankine again worked for the government, this time on the development of the [[Fog Investigation and Dispersal Operation (FIDO)|FIDO]] system for clearing fog from military runways.<ref name="The Times"/>
This work was done with the [[Petroleum Warfare Department]],<ref name="Who's Who"/> and he contributed to both the design and testing done on the system in wind tunnels at the Empress Hall, [[Earls Court Exhibition Centre|Earls Court]].<ref name="IC History"/> The system was then developed further by [[Arthur Hartley]], and when brought into operation helped to save the lives of many World War II aircrews.

After the war, Rankine resumed his work with the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company for a few years before resigning from full-time work in 1947.<ref name="The Times"/> He continued as an advisor for the company until 1954 when his health began to break down.<ref name="The Times"/> Rankine died at the age of 74{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} in a nursing home in his home town of [[Hampton, London|Hampton]], London, on 20 January 1956,.<ref name="The Times"/><ref name="CDSB"/><ref>The date of death may have been 19 January, as noted by The Royal Society, which also fits with the details in the obituary in ''The Times''.</ref> His obituary was published in ''The Times'' and in ''Nature''.<ref name="The Times"/><ref>{{cite doi|10.1038/177408a0|noedit}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Rankine was married with four children,{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} and died in 1956 at the age of 74.
