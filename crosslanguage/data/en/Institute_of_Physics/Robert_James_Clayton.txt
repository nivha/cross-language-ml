'''Sir Robert James Clayton''' [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]], (30 October 1915, [[Fulham]], [[London]] - 20 June 1998, [[London Borough of Brent|Brent]], [[Middlesex]], [[UK]]) electronics engineer, was notable in the area of defense and industrial electronics. Clayton is credited with playing a significant role in the post-war development of electronics in the [[United Kingdom]].<ref>http://physicsworld.com/cws/index/print/1998 Physics World, Sep 1998, p.53</ref>

==Early life==
He was the only son of Frank Clayton, wine merchant's assistant, and his wife, Flora, née Gillbanks. His parents had a struggle to support themselves because his father, originally a clerk, had been invalided out of the services in the [[First World War]] and could seek only outdoor work. Thoughts of emigration to Canada were thwarted by his father's early death and Clayton's mother had to make a meagre living as a dressmaker. In later years he said that in effect he had been brought up by the [[The Scout Association|Boy Scouts]], convincing him that he could succeed by his own efforts. Clayton won two county scholarships leading to a major scholarship at [[Christ's College, Cambridge]], specializing in [[physics]].

==Career==
Upon graduating in 1937 he joined the [[General Electric Company]] (GEC) research laboratories, at that time one of the leading industrial research centres, to work on the company's new television receivers. In spite of the turmoil of the emerging electronics industry, for the rest of his career he remained with GEC. With the outbreak of war the GEC laboratories were soon in the forefront of [[radar]] development and Clayton's expertise was quickly applied to the development of airborne radar equipment. When the [[BBC]] resumed television service from [[Alexandra Palace]] after the war GEC won the important contract to implement the first link to another transmitter at [[Birmingham]]. This was based on Clayton's advanced proposal for a microwave radio relay. He coerced the rest of the laboratories to assist in bringing television to Birmingham on time in 1950.

In 1955 GEC invited Clayton to establish its new Applied Electronics Laboratories at Stanmore to create a defence electronics capability, initially centred on developing missile guidance systems for the [[Royal Navy]]. By 1963 all the diverse GEC activities in electronics were brought together with Clayton as managing director. At this point [[Arnold Weinstock]] took control of the vulnerable GEC and with government encouragement embarked on the rationalization of the fragmented UK electrical industry. He soon recognized that Clayton could provide the necessary technical input to his own financial acumen and in 1968 appointed Clayton technical director of the enlarged company. Clayton continued in this role, while turning his attention from streamlining the overlapping activities of the acquired companies to future ventures. However, Weinstock's growing financial caution was a limiting factor and after Clayton joined the main board in 1978 he acted mainly in an advisory role and as the technical presence of the GEC on major issues, until he retired in 1983.

During the period of rationalization of the UK electronics industry he was often perceived as a hard man who implemented Weinstock's plans. Equally, others saw him as protecting the essential research and development activities and endeavouring to move GEC into areas of future growth—often against a company culture of short-termism.

==Personal life==
On 2 April 1949 he married Joy Kathleen (c. 1925–1997), daughter of Allan McFarlane King, an electrician, and they moved to live at [[Stanmore]]. They had no children.

In his retirement ill health and blindness increasingly restricted his activities. He was widowed in 1997 when his wife died. He died at [[Northwick Park Hospital]], [[London Borough of Brent|Brent]], on 20 June 1998. His cremation was marked only by an informal gathering of friends and the dedication of a copse of trees of the Woodland Trust. His wealth at death exceeded £2 million.

==Honors==
He was a Fellow of the [[Royal Aeronautical Society]]; an Honorary Fellow of the [[Institution of Electrical Engineers]], becoming President in 1975; and a Fellow of the [[Institute of Physics]], becoming President in 1982. He was also a Fellow of the Fellowship of Engineering (later the [[Royal Academy of Engineering]]) and its Vice-president for 1980–82. In 1983 he was made an Honorary Fellow of [[Christ's College, Cambridge]]. He was awarded a number of Honorary Doctorates, for example Honorary Doctor of Science degrees from [[Aston University]] in 1979<ref>http://www1.aston.ac.uk/about/history/honorary-graduates/</ref> and [[City University London]] in 1981.<ref>http://www.city.ac.uk/about/city-information/governance/honorary-graduates/honorary-graduates-a-z</ref> Graduating at the same Aston ceremony in 1979 was [[Kevin Warwick]], who also went on to obtain an Honorary Doctor of Science degree from Aston University.<ref>http://www1.aston.ac.uk/about/history/honorary-graduates/</ref>

Another outcome was the invitation to join many ‘[[quangos]]’, including the [[National Enterprise Board]] (1978–80), the [[National Electronics Council]] (1973–83), the parliamentary and scientific committee (1983–6), and the [[Monopolies and Mergers Commission]] (1983–9). At various times he also served on the University Grants Committee; standing conference on schools, science & technology; the advisory council of the Science Museum; and the [[British Library]] board. His earlier work at the GEC had led to the award of an [[OBE]] (1960) and [[CBE]] (1970), and, with later contributions to public matters, a [[knighthood]] in 1980.
