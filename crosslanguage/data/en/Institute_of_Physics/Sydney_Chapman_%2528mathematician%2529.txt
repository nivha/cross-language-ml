}}'''Sydney Chapman''' [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] (29 January 1888&nbsp;– 16 June 1970)<ref name="frs"/> was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[mathematician]] and [[Geophysics|geophysicist]].<ref name=SSR>{{Cite doi|10.1007/BF00177026}}</ref> His work on the [[Kinetic theory|kinetic theory of gases]], solar-terrestrial [[physics]], and the [[Earth]]'s [[ozone layer]] has inspired a broad range of [[research]] over many decades.<ref name="mathgene">{{MathGenealogy|id=122622}}</ref><ref name=Eos>{{cite doi|10.1029/2011EO340001 }}</ref><ref name="mactutor">{{MacTutor Biography|id=Chapman}}</ref>

== Biography==
Chapman was born in [[Eccles, Greater Manchester|Eccles]], near [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]] in England and began his advanced studies at a technical institute, now the [[University of Salford]], in 1902.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Biographical Encyclopedia of Astronomers |last=Hockey |first=Thomas |year=2009 |publisher=[[Springer Publishing]] |isbn=978-0-387-31022-0 |accessdate=August 22, 2012 |url=http://www.springerreference.com/docs/html/chapterdbid/58269.html}}</ref>  In 1904 at age 16, Chapman entered the [[University of Manchester]]. He competed for a [[scholarship]] to the university offered by his home [[county]], and was the last [[student]] selected. Chapman later reflected, "I sometimes wonder what would have happened if I'd hit one place lower."<ref name=Eos/> He initially studied engineering in the department headed by [[Osborne Reynolds]]. Chapman was taught mathematics by [[Horace Lamb]], the Beyer professor of mathematics, and [[John Edensor Littlewood|J.E. Littlewood]], who came from Cambridge in Chapman's final year at Manchester. Although he graduated with an engineering degree, Chapman had become so enthusiastic for mathematics that he stayed for one further year to take a mathematics degree. Following Lamb's suggestion, Chapman applied for a scholarship to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]. He was at first awarded only a partial scholarship as a [[sizar]] (meaning that he obtained financial support by acting as a servant other students), but from his second year onwards he received a full scholarship. He graduated as a [[Wrangler (University of Cambridge)|wrangler]] in 1910.<ref name="mactutor"/> He began his research in [[pure mathematics]] under [[G. H. Hardy]], but later that year was asked by [[Frank Watson Dyson|Sir Frank Dyson]] to be his chief assistant at the [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich|Royal Greenwich Observatory]].  From 1914 to 1919 he returned to Cambridge as a lecturer in mathematics and a fellow of Trinity.  He held the [[Beyer Chair of Applied Mathematics]] at Manchester from 1919 to 1924, the same position as had been held by Lamb, and then moved to [[Imperial College London]]. During the [[World War II|Second World War]] he was Deputy Scientific Advisor to the Army Council.<ref name="mactutor"/>

In 1946, Chapman was elected to the [[Sedleian Professor of Natural Philosophy|Sedleian Chair of Natural Philosophy]] at Oxford, and was appointed fellow of [[The Queen's College, Oxford]]. In 1953, on his retirement from Oxford, Chapman took research and teaching opportunities all over the world,<ref name=SSR/> including at the [[University of Alaska]] and the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]], but also as far afield as [[Istanbul]], [[Cairo]], [[Prague]], and [[Tokyo]]. As the Advisory Scientific Director of the University of Alaska [[Geophysical Institute]] from 1951 to 1970, he spent three months of the year in [[Alaska]], usually during winter for research into aurora.<ref>{{cite web | author=Keith B. Mather | title=Introduction to Sydney Chapman| url=http://www.gi.alaska.edu/chapman/intro.html | publisher=Geophysical Institute | accessdate=20 December 2010}}</ref> Much of the remainder of the year he spent at the [[High Altitude Observatory]] in Boulder, Colorado.

The relationship of Chapman with some German geophysicists (e.g. Ertel, Bartels, and A. Schmidt) has been investigated by Wilfried Schröder.<ref>Acate Geophysica and Geodetica Hungarigca, 2009</ref>

In 1970, Chapman died in [[Boulder, Colorado]] at the age of 82.<ref name="mactutor"/>

== Work ==
Chapman's most noted mathematical accomplishments were in the field of [[stochastic processes]] (random processes), especially [[Markov process]]es. In his study of Markovian stochastic processes and their generalizations, Chapman and the Russian [[Andrey Kolmogorov]] independently developed the pivotal set of equations in the field, the [[Chapman–Kolmogorov equation]]s. Chapman is credited with working out, in 1930, the photochemical mechanisms that give rise to the [[ozone layer]].<ref name=80friends>Sydney Chapman, eighty: From His Friends

Chapman is also recognized as one of the pioneers of solar-terrestrial physics.<ref name =SSR />  This interest stemmed from his early work on the kinetic theory of gases. Chapman studied [[Geomagnetic storm|magnetic storms]] and [[Aurora (astronomy)|aurorae]], developing theories to explain their relation to the interaction of the [[Earth's magnetic field]] with the [[solar wind]]. He disputed and ridiculed the work of Kristian Birkeland and Hannes Alfven, later adopting Birkeland's theories as his own.<ref>Lucy Jago (2001). The Northern Lights. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. ISBN 0-375-40980-7</ref><ref>{{cite doi|10.1098/rspa.1911.0019}}</ref> Chapman and his first [[graduate student]], V. C. A. Ferraro, predicted the presence of the [[magnetosphere]] in the early 1930s. They also predicted characteristics of the magnetosphere that were confirmed 30 years later by the [[Explorer program|Explorer 12 satellite]].<ref name=Eos/>

In 1940 Chapman and a German colleague [[Julius Bartels]] at the [[Carnegie Institution of Washington]] published a book in two volumes <ref name="CB1940a">{{cite book|title=Geomagnetism, Vol. I, Geomagnetic and Related Phenomena|year=1940|publisher=Oxford Univ. Press|author=Sydney Chapman|coauthors=J. Bartels}}</ref><ref name="CB1940b">{{cite book|title=Geomagnetism, Vol. II, Analysis and Physical Interpretation of the Phenomena|year=1940|publisher=Oxford Univ. Press|author=Sydney Chapman|coauthors=J. Bartels}}</ref> on geomagnetism, which was to become the standard text book for the next two decades.<ref name=Eos/>

Chapman was President of the Special Committee for the [[International Geophysical Year]] (IGY).  The idea of the IGY stemmed from a discussion in 1950 between Chapman and scientists including [[James Van Allen]].   The IGY was held in 1957–58, and resulted in great progress in fields including Earth and space sciences, as well as leading to the first [[satellite]] launches. Chapman's role in the IGY and his support for amateur's work in auroras and noctilucent clouds, especially also with the Germans, has been discussed by Wilfried Schröder.<ref>Schröder, W., ''Beiträge Geschichte der Geophysik und Kosmische Physik'', Volume 2008</ref>

== Honours ==
Chapman was bestowed many honours over his career including [[Smith's Prize]] in 1913,<ref name="mactutor"/> election as a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1919,<ref name="frs"/> Royal Society [[Bakerian lecture]]r in 1931, Royal Society [[Royal Medal]] in 1934, [[London Mathematical Society]] [[De Morgan Medal]] in 1944. In 1949, he was awarded the [[Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society]] and was elected as a [[Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh]] in 1953. In 1964, he was awarded the [[Copley Medal]] of the [[Royal Society]]. He was elected to the National Academies of Science of the United States, Norway, Sweden and Finland.<ref name="mactutor"/> He served as President of the [[London Mathematical Society]] during 1929–1931 and the [[Royal Meteorological Society]] 1932–1933.

The lunar [[Chapman (crater)|Crater Chapman]] is named in his honour, as is the Sydney Chapman Building on the campus of the [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]]. This building served as the first permanent home of the University of Alaska Geophysical Institute, and it now contains the Department of Computer Science and the Department of Mathematics and Statistics. The [[American Geophysical Union]] organizes "Chapman Conferences," which are small, topical meetings intended to foster innovative research in key areas.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chapman Conferences|url=http://www.agu.org/meetings/chapman/|accessdate=28 August 2011}}</ref>
