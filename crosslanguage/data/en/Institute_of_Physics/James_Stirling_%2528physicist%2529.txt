'''William James Stirling''' [[CBE]], [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]], [[FInstP]] (born 4 February 1953) is the first [[Provost of Imperial College London]]. He was appointed to this role in August 2013.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/newsandeventspggrp/imperialcollege/newssummary/news_12-12-2012-15-20-50 | title = James Stirling to be Imperial's first Provost | publisher = Imperial College London | date = 12 December 2012 | accessdate = 14 January 2013}}</ref>

==Biography==
He was born in [[Belfast]] and  grew up in [[Glengormley]], Co. Antrim, attending first Glengormley Primary School and then [[Belfast Royal Academy]]. He was admitted as an undergraduate to [[Peterhouse]], [[Cambridge University]], in 1972, taking a First in Part IB and Part II of the Mathematical Tripos and a Distinction in Part III. He graduated [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in 1975, and continued at Peterhouse to take a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] (1979) in Theoretical Particle Physics in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics. He won a [[Smith's Prize]] for Mathematics in 1978.

After periods of research in the USA, Cambridge and the [[European Organization for Nuclear Research]] ([[CERN]]) in Geneva, Stirling was appointed to a lectureship at [[Durham University]] in 1986. In 2000 he became the first Director of the University's new Institute for Particle Physics Phenomenology (IPPP), which together with the Institute for Computational Cosmology, forms part of the Ogden Centre for Fundamental Physics. 

From 2001 to 2003, he served as the first Chair of the [[Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council]]  Science Committee, the research council's top-level scientific advisory committee. He was a member of the Physics Sub-Panel in two [[Research Assessment Exercise]]s (2001 and 2008) and was Deputy Chair of the 2008 panel.

At Cambridge he was the [[Jacksonian Professor of Natural Philosophy]], Head of the [[Cavendish Laboratory]], and [[Fellow]] of [[Peterhouse]] at the [[University of Cambridge]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/reporter/2008-09/special/03/21.html | title = Fellows of Peterhouse College, 2008-09 | publisher = Cambridge University Reporter | date = 2008-10-02 | accessdate = 2009-06-17}}</ref>

Stirling's research area is theoretical [[particle physics]]. In a research career spanning more than 30 years, he has published more than 300 research papers, including some of the most frequently cited papers in the physical sciences. His particular research interest is particle physics phenomenology – the interface between theory and experiment – and he works closely with experimentalists at research laboratories in Europe and the United States.  He is a member of the internationally renowned MSTW collaboration that studies the ‘[[parton (particle physics)|parton]]’ structure of the [[proton]].

In recognition of his contribution to particle physics research, Stirling was elected to the Fellowship of the [[Royal Society]] in May 1999.  He was awarded a [[CBE]] in the [[2006 New Year Honours]] list, for services to science. He was a member of the Council of the Royal Society in 2007-8, and currently (2009 - ) serves on the Council of the [[Science and Technology Facilities Council]] (STFC).
