'''IOP Publishing''' (previously named Institute of Physics Publishing) is the publishing company of the [[Institute of Physics]]. It provides publications through which scientific research is distributed worldwide, including journals, community websites, magazines, conference proceedings and books. The Institute of Physics is a scientific charity devoted to increasing the practice, understanding and application of physics. Any financial surplus earned by IOP Publishing goes to support physics through the activities of the Institute.

The main IOP Publishing headquarters is located in Bristol, England and the North American headquarters is based in Philadelphia, United States. It also has several regional offices including Washington, D.C.; Mexico City, Beijing; Tokyo; Moscow; St. Petersburg; Munich; and Sydney. It employs over 300 staff.

It was the first physics publisher to publish a journal on the internet. In 1994, the journal [[Classical and Quantum Gravity]] was published as a [[TeX]] file. In January 1996, the organisation launched the full electronic journals programme on the [[World Wide Web]], ahead of other physics publishers.<ref>{{cite book |title=125 Years: The Physical Society & The Institute of Physics |year=1999}}</ref>

==Journals==
IOP Publishing publishes over 70 journals which are available in print and online. IOPscience is the online service for the journal content. Journals include:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ioppublishing.org/publications/journals |title=Journals |publisher=Ioppublishing.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-20}}</ref>
