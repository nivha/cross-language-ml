'''James Jeffrey Binney''', [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]], [[FInstP]] (born 1950 in [[Surrey]]) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[astrophysics|astrophysicist]]. He is a Professor of [[Physics]] at the [[University of Oxford]], where he is head of the Sub-Department of Theoretical Physics as well as a Professorial Fellow at [[Merton College, Oxford|Merton College]]. Binney is known principally for his work in theoretical galactic and extragalactic astrophysics, but he has made a number of contributions to areas outside of astrophysics as well.

==Education and career==
Binney took a first class BA in the [[Mathematical Tripos]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1971, then moved to the [[University of Oxford]], reading for a [[DPhil]] at [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]] under [[Dennis Sciama]], which he completed in 1975. He was a visiting scholar at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in 1983-87 and again in the fall of 1989.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Community of Scholars|url=http://www.ias.edu/people/cos/|publisher=Institute for Advanced Study|accessdate=1 May 2013}}</ref> After holding several post-doctoral positions, including a Junior Research Fellowship at [[Magdalen College, Oxford|Magdalen College]], and a position at [[Princeton University]], Binney returned to Oxford as a University Lecturer and Fellow and Tutor in Physics at [[Merton College, Oxford|Merton College]] in 1981.  He was subsequently made Ad Hominem Reader in Theoretical Physics in 1991 and Professor of Physics in 1996.

Binney has received a number of awards and honours for his work, including the [[Maxwell Medal and Prize|Maxwell Prize]] of the [[Institute of Physics]] in 1986, the [[Brouwer Award (Division on Dynamical Astronomy)|Brouwer Award]] of the [[American Astronomical Society]] in 2003, the [[Dirac Prize|Dirac Medal]] in 2010,<ref>{{cite web|title=2010 Dirac medal|url=http://www.iop.org/about/awards/gold/dirac/medallists/page_43949.html|publisher=Institute of Physics|accessdate=1 May 2013}}</ref> and the [[Eddington Medal]] in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title=Winners of the 2013 awards, medals and prizes - full details|url=http://www.ras.org.uk/awards-and-grants/awards/2210-winners-of-the-2013-awards-medals-and-prizes|publisher=Royal Astronomical Society|accessdate=1 May 2013}}</ref> He has been a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society since 1973, and was made a [[Royal Society|Fellow of the Royal Society]] and a Fellow of the Institute of Physics, both in 2000. He sits on the European Advisory Board of [[Princeton University Press]].<ref>{{cite web|title=European Advisory Board|url=http://press.princeton.edu/about_pup/european_advisory_board.html|publisher=Princeton University Press|accessdate=1 May 2013|date=7 July 2011}}</ref>

==Interests==
Binney's research interests have included:

* Physics of [[cooling flow]]s and the processes of [[Active galactic nuclei|AGN feedback]];
* Supernova disruption of galactic disk gas;
* Dynamics of galaxies, including those of the [[Milky Way]];
* Galaxy and orbit modelling, including development of torus modelling techniques.

==Publications==
Binney has authored over a hundred articles in peer-reviewed journals, and several textbooks, including ''Galactic Dynamics'', which has long been considered the standard work of reference in its field.
