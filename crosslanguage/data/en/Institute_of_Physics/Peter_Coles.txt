'''Peter Coles''' is a theoretical cosmologist and head of the School of Mathematical and Physical Sciences at the [[University of Sussex]], a post he took up in February 2013.<ref>http://www.sussex.ac.uk/newsandevents/?id=16086</ref>

He was born in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] and educated at the [[Royal Grammar School, Newcastle]]. He did his first degree at [[Magdalene College, Cambridge]], in Natural Sciences, specialising in Theoretical Physics, graduating in 1985. He then studied for his doctorate at the [[University of Sussex]] and completed his thesis in 1988.

His primary research interest is in [[Cosmology]], specifically on theoretical models that try to account for the properties of the [[Observable Universe]], including the [[Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation]]. He is the author of a number of books on this and related subjects, including a textbook, "Cosmology: the origin and evolution of cosmic structure" (ISBN #0471489093, co-authored with Francesco Lucchin).

Coles was a professor of Theoretical Astrophysics at [[Cardiff University]] from 2007 to 2013.<ref>http://www.astro.cf.ac.uk/contactsandpeople/?page=full&id=86</ref> He previously worked at the [[University of Nottingham]], [[Queen Mary, University of London]], and the [[University of Sussex]].
 
He currently resides in [[Brighton]]. Among the places he has previously lived in are [[Pontcanna]] in [[Cardiff]], [[Beeston, Nottinghamshire|Beeston]] in [[Nottinghamshire]] and [[Bethnal Green]] in London.

He is a Fellow of the [[Royal Astronomical Society]] and of the [[Institute of Physics]].
