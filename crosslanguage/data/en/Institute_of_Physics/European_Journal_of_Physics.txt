*Original insights into the derivation of results
*Descriptions of new laboratory exercises 
*Scholarly or reflective articles at appropriate levels
*Descriptions of successful original student projects
*Discussions of the [[history of physics|history]] and  [[philosophy of physics]].
*Reports of new developments in methods for teaching physics and in the physics curriculum.

The Editor in Chief is Jan Mostowski, [[Polish Academy of Sciences]], Warsaw, Poland, who took over the role from Alastair I. M. Rae, formerly lecturer at the School of Physics and Astronomy,  [[University of Birmingham]], UK in 2010.

The journal had an [[Impact factor]] of  0.644 for 2012, according to [[Journal Citation Reports]].
