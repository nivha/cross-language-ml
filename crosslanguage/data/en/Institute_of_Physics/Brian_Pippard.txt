'''Sir Alfred Brian Pippard''', [[ScD]], [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] (7 September 1920 &ndash; 21 September 2008),<ref>{{cite doi|10.1098/rsbm.2009.0014}}</ref> was a [[United Kingdom|British]] physicist. He was [[Cavendish Professor of Physics]] from 1971 until 1984 and an Honorary Fellow of [[Clare Hall, Cambridge]], of which he was the first President. He was educated at [[Clifton College]].

Pippard demonstrated the reality, as opposed to the mere abstract concept, of [[Fermi surface|Fermi surfaces]] in metals by establishing the shape of the Fermi surface of [[copper]] through measuring the reflection and absorption of microwave electromagnetic radiation<ref>{{cite doi|10.1098/rsta.1957.0023}}</ref> (see the [[anomalous skin effect]] <ref>N. W. Ashcroft, and N. D. Mermin, ''Solid State Physics'' (Thompson Learning, Inc., London, 1976), Chapter 14, ''Measuring the Fermi Surface'', p. 277, ''Anomalous Skin Effect''. ISBN 0-03-083993-9. See ''[[Classical skin depth]]''.</ref>). He also introduced the notion of [[coherence length]] in [[superconductors]] in his proposal for the non-local generalisation of the [[London equations|Londons' equations]]<ref>F. London, ''Superfluids'', Vol. I: ''Macroscopic Theory of Superconductivity'' (Dover Publications, New York, 1961), p. 152.</ref> concerning [[electrodynamics]] in [[superfluids]] and superconductors. The non-local kernel proposed by Pippard,<ref>{{cite doi|10.1098/rsta.1970.0075}}</ref><ref>{{cite doi|10.1098/rsta.1964.0008}}</ref><ref>{{cite doi|10.1098/rsta.1955.0011}}</ref> inferred on the basis of Chambers' non-local generalisation of [[Ohm's law]]) can be deduced within the framework of the [[BCS theory|BCS]] ([[John Bardeen|Bardeen]], [[Leon Cooper|Cooper]] and [[John Robert Schrieffer|Schrieffer]]) theory of  superconductivity<ref>J. Bardeen, L. N. Cooper, and J. R. Schrieffer, ''Theory of Superconductivity'', Phys. Rev., Vol. '''108''', No. 5, pp. 1175-1204 (1957). [http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PR/v108/i5/p1175_1 APS (Free Download)]</ref> (a comprehensive description of the details of the London-Pippard theory can be found in the book by Fetter and Walecka<ref>A. L. Fetter, and J. D. Walecka, ''Quantum Theory of Many-Particle Systems'' (Dover Publications, New York, 2003), Chapter 13, ''Superconductivity'', Section 49, ''London-Pippard Phenomenological Theory''. ISBN 0-486-42827-3.</ref>).

Pippard was the author of ''Elements of Classical Thermodynamics for Advanced Students of Physics'',<ref>A. B. Pippard, ''Elements of Classical Thermodynamics for Advanced Students of Physics'' (Cambridge University Press, 1957). ISBN 0-521-09101-2.</ref>
''Dynamics of Conduction Electrons'',<ref>A. B. Pippard, ''Dynamics of Conduction Electrons'', Documents on Modern Physics (Gordon & Beach, 1965).</ref> and ''The Physics of Vibration''.<ref>A. B. Pippard, ''The Physics of Vibration'' (Cambridge University Press, 2007). ISBN 0-521-03333-0.</ref> He is also a co-author of the three-volumes encyclopaedia ''Twentieth Century Physics''.<ref>Laurie M. Brown, [[Abraham Pais]], and Brian Pippard, ''Twentieth Century Physics'' (Institute of Physics Publishing, 1995): Vol. I, 808 p., ISBN 0-7503-0353-0, 
Vol. II, 808 p., ISBN 0-7503-0354-9, Vol. III, 960 p., ISBN 0-7503-0355-7.</ref> As the Cavendish Professor of Physics at [[Cavendish Laboratory]], University of Cambridge, he complied ''Cavendish Problems in Classical Physics'',<ref>A. B. Pippard, ''Cavendish Problems in Classical Physics'' (Pamphlet) (Cambridge University Press, 1962). A. B. Pippard, ''Cavendish Problems in Classical Physics'' (Pamphlet), 64 p. (Cambridge University Press, 1971)</ref> based in large part on past examination questions for Cambridge physics students.

Pippard was the doctoral supervisor of [[Brian David Josephson]] (awarded [[PhD]] in Physics in 1964) who in 1973 received the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] (together with [[Leo Esaki]] and [[Ivar Giaever]]) for his discovery of what is known as the [[Josephson effect]].<ref>B. D. Josephson, ''Possible new effects in superconductive tunnelling'', Phys. Lett., Vol. '''1''', pp. 251-253 (1962).</ref>
