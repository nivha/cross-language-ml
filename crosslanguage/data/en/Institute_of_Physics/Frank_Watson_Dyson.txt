'''Sir Frank Watson Dyson''', [[Order of the British Empire|KBE]], [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]]<ref name="frs">{{cite doi|10.1098/rsbm.1940.0015}}</ref> (8 January 1868 &ndash; 25 May 1939) was an [[England|English]] [[astronomer]] and [[Astronomer Royal]] who is remembered today largely for introducing time signals ("pips") from Greenwich, England, and for the role he played in proving Einstein's theory of general relativity.

== Biography ==
Dyson was born in [[Measham]], near [[Ashby-de-la-Zouch]], Leicestershire, the son of the Rev Watson Dyson, but soon moved to Yorkshire. There he attended [[Heath Grammar School]], [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], and subsequently won scholarships to [[Bradford Grammar School]] and [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]], where he studied mathematics and astronomy, being placed [[Second Wrangler]] in 1889.<ref>{{acad|id=DY886FW|name=Dyson, Frank Watson}}</ref>

In 1894 he was given the post of Senior Assistant at Greenwich Observatory and worked on the [[Astrographic Catalogue]], which was published in 1905.<ref name = Harvard>{{cite web | url = http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1939Obs....62..179S|title = Obituary: Sir Frank Watson Dyson| accessdate = 2012-05-17}}</ref>

He was appointed [[Astronomer Royal for Scotland]] from 1905 to 1910, and Astronomer Royal (and director of the [[Royal Greenwich Observatory]]) from 1910 to 1933. In 1928, he introduced in the Observatory a new [[Shortt-Synchronome clock|free-pendulum clock]], the most accurate clock available at that time and organised the regular wireless transmission from the GPO wireless station at Rugby of [[Greenwich Mean Time]]. He also, in 1924, introduced the distribution of the "[[Greenwich Time Signal|six pips]]" via the BBC. He was for several years President of the [[British Horological Institute]] and was awarded their Gold Medal in 1928.<ref name = Harvard/>

Dyson was noted for his study of [[solar eclipse]]s and was an authority on the [[spectrum]] of the [[corona]] and on the chromosphere.  He is credited with organizing expeditions to observe the 1919 solar eclipse at [[Brazil]] and [[Principe]], observations from which confirmed [[Einstein]]'s theory of the effect of gravity on light.

Dyson died while travelling from Australia to England in 1939 and was buried at sea. He had married Caroline Bisset Best, the daughter of Palemon Best, with whom he had two sons and six daughters.<ref name = Harvard/>

==Frank Dyson and Freeman Dyson==
Frank Dyson and theoretical physicist [[Freeman Dyson]] are not related. However, the latter does credit Sir Frank with sparking his interest in astronomy; because they shared the same last name, Sir Frank's achievements were discussed by Freeman Dyson's family when he was a young boy.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} Inspired, Dyson's first attempt at writing was a 1931 piece of [[juvenilia]] entitled "Sir Phillip Robert's Erolunar Collision" &mdash; Sir Philip being a thinly disguised version of Sir Frank.
