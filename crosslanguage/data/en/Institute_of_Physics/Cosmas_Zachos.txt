'''Cosmas K. Zachos''' ({{lang-el|Κοσμάς Ζάχος}}; born 1951, [[Athens]]) is a  [[theoretical]] [[physicist]]. He was educated in physics ([[undergraduate]] A.B. 1974) at [[Princeton University]], and did graduate work in theoretical physics at the [[California Institute of Technology]] (Ph.D. 1979) under the supervision of [[John Henry Schwarz]].   
 
Zachos is  a staff member in the theory group of the High Energy Physics Division of [[Argonne National Laboratory]].  He is considered an authority  on the subject of [[Phase space formulation |phase-space quantization]].  His early research involved, jointly, the introduction of [[renormalization]] Geometrostasis, and the so-called FFZ [[Lie algebra]] of [[Noncommutative geometry]]. His thesis work revealed a balancing repulsive gravitational force present in Extended [[Supergravity]].  

He is co-author of treatises on [[quantum mechanics]] in [[phase space]],<ref>Cosmas K. Zachos, David B. Fairlie, and Thomas L. Curtright, ''Quantum Mechanics in Phase Space''.  (World Scientific,  Singapore, 2005) ISBN 978-981-238-384-6  [http://www.worldscibooks.com/physics/5287.html].</ref><ref>[[Thomas Curtright|Thomas L. Curtright]], [[David Fairlie|David B.

a Fellow of the [[American Physical Society]], and a Fellow of the [[Institute of Physics]].
He is the brother of theoretical computer scientist [[Stathis Zachos]].
