'''Bruce Allen'''  (born May 11, 1959) is an American physicist and director of the [[Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics]] in [[Hannover]] [[Germany]] and leader of the [[Einstein@Home]] project for the [[LIGO Scientific Collaboration]]. He is also a physics professor at the [[University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee]].  

He has done research work on models of the very early universe (inflationary cosmology, cosmic strings).  Allen currently leads a research group working on the detection of [[gravitational waves]]. Allen's research work has been funded by the [[US National Science Foundation]] since 1987.
