==Education and background==
His family moved to [[Flixton, Greater Manchester|Flixton]], [[Lancashire]] when he was 18 months. He attended [[Stretford Grammar School]] in Manchester. Wolfendale was graduated with a [[Bachelor of Science]] in physics from the [[University of Manchester]] in 1948, followed by a [[PhD]] in 1953<ref name="wolfendalephd">{{cite thesis |degree=PhD |first=Arnold|last=Wolfendale |title=The nuclear interactions of mu-mesons  |publisher=University of Manchester |date=1953 |url=http://www.theses.com|authorlink=Arnold Wolfendale}}{{subscription required}}</ref> and a [[Doctor of Science]] in 1970.

==Career==
During his career he held academic posts at the universities of [[University of Manchester]] (1951–6), [[Durham University]] (1956–92), the [[University of Ceylon]] and the [[University of Hong Kong]], and was head of department at Durham where he remains an [[emeritus]] professor. He was Professor of Physics at Durham from 1965–92.

==Awards and honours==
Wolfendale was elected a fellow of the [[Royal Astronomical Society]] in 1973, and a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]] in 1977.<ref name="royal"/> He served as Astronomer Royal from 1991 to 1995. In 1992, Wolfendale retired from teaching, and he was knighted in 1995. In 1996 he became Professor of Experimental Physics with the [[Royal Institution of Great Britain]]. A lecture theatre in Durham University's new Calman Learning Centre has been named in his honour. He is an honorary DSc of Bucharest University and foreign member of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences. His nomination for the Royal Society reads{{centered pull quote|Distinguished for his many contributions to the study of the cosmic radiation through a wide-ranging series of experimental investigations and critical analyses of cosmic ray data. Well known for his development of two novel techniques: the neon flash tube, a visual detector of great stability used widely in spectrographs and cosmic ray neutrino and quark studies, and the 'solid iron' spectrograph. Internationally recognised as the leading authority on muon spectra and charge ratios at ground level and at various depths underground in the energy range 5 x 10 [to the power of] 8-10 [to the power of 13] eV, measurements which are among the most basic data of cosmic rays. Measured the spectra of cosmic ray protons, neutrons and pions and from these data and the muon spectrum determined the primary spectrum and K/pi ratio. Results on the interactions of muons were of importance in a number of other investigations, e.g. in the Davis experiment on solar neutrinos. Introduction of the neon flash tube technique to the Indian and South African experiments on cosmic ray neutrinos was decisive and led to the clear identification of neutrino interactions and the determination of the cross section as a function of energy. Has established recently fine astrophysical groups in Durham which have already made useful contributions to the theory of the propagation of cosmic rays in the galaxy, to the explanation of the ultra-high energy end of the primary spectrum and to the origin of the gamma-ray background radiation. His optical group under Scarrott has recently obtained a beautiful map of the galaxy M82 in Rayleigh scattered light, and from it an accurate position for the luminous nucleus.<ref name="royal">{{cite web|url=http://royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqDb=Catalog&dsqCmd=show.tcl&dsqSearch=(RefNo==%27EC%2F1977%2F39%27)|title = Library and Archive Catalogue Wolfendale|publisher=The Royal Society|archivedate=2013-12-19|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6LymiXlpW|location=London}}</ref>}}

==Personal life==
He married Audrey Darby in 1951. They had twin sons. His wife died in 2007. He is also patron of the Durham Dramatic Society, an amateur theatre troupe which is a member of the Little Theatre Guild of Great Britain. They have also met Ian McKellan.
