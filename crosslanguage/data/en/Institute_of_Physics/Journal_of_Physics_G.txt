'''''Journal of Physics G: Nuclear and Particle Physics''''' is a [[peer-reviewed]] journal that publishes [[theoretical]] and [[experimental research]] into [[nuclear physics]], [[particle physics]] and [[particle astrophysics]], including all interface areas between these fields.

The editor-in-chief is Professor [[Achim Schwenk]], [[Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt]], [[Germany]].

==Scope==
The journal publishes research articles on:
* theoretical and experimental topics in the physics of elementary particles and fields;
* intermediate-energy physics and nuclear physics;
* experimental and theoretical research in particle, neutrino, and nuclear astrophysics;
* research arising from all interface areas among these fields.

Research is published in the following formats:
* Research Papers: Reports of original and high-quality research work;
* Research Notes: Contributions from individuals (or small groups) within large collaborations, containing early results of analyses, detector development, simulations, etc. which might not otherwise be published in the wider literature;
* Topical Reviews: Specially commissioned review articles on areas of current interest;
* LabTalk: Article summaries written by the researchers themselves which introduce the findings, techniques, and possible applications of their research.<ref>http://ej.iop.org/pdf/pricing/catalogue2013.pdf</ref><ref>http://iopscience.iop.org/0954-3899/page/Scope</ref>

==Abstracting and indexing information==
The journal is indexed in [[INSPEC]] Information Services, [[Institute for Scientific Information|ISI]] (Science Citation Index, SciSearch, ISI Alerting Services, Current Contents/Physical, Chemical and Earth Sciences), Article@[[INIST]], and [[Chemical Abstracts]].
