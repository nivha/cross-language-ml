Now he is involved with all things photographic including deep-sky imaging, macrophotography, microphotography, pin-hole camera photography and high-speed flash photography [http://www.highspeedflash.com/] he is the designer and developer of revolutionary new ultra-high speed Xenon flash equipment.  His general photographic work is featured on the Scientific Artist web site [http://www.scientificartist.com/]

He has published over 120 refereed journal and conference papers, a textbook on Solid-State Physics called Introductory Semiconductor Device Physics ISBN 0-7503-1021-9, a "How to" book on Deep-Sky astrophotography titled "Making Beautiful Deep-Sky Images" ISBN 978-0-387-71352-6, and a large format coffee-table book of deep-sky images taken from the New Forest Observatory [http://www.newforestobservatory.com/] called Star Vistas ISBN 978-0-387-88435-6.  He has 13 granted patents on optical devices and circuits and has created three successful companies.  His most recent spin-out from Southampton University was Mesophotonics Ltd. [http://www.mesophotonics.com].

At present he is constructing the World's most powerful amateur deep-sky imaging system, the mini-WASP imaging array, named after the SuperWASP array [http://www.superwasp.org/] built for the Wide Angle Search for Planets.  His deep-sky imaging work and his progress on the construction of the mini-WASP array can be followed on his New Forest Observatory web site [http://www.newforestobservatory.com/]
