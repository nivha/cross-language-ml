==Supplementary notes==
In 2003 he suffered a severe [[stroke]] and was hospitalised for five months.<ref>http://www.the-effective-engineer.com/interview.html</ref> He had to relearn to stand and walk, but his cognition was unaffected. After his rehabilitation period he is able to drive a specially modified car.

After 1996 he concentrated more on authorship, postgraduate and postdoctoral mentoring at Cardiff University, International Standards and Conference presentations. He is involved in conferences, and independent consultancy, as well as schemes to Publicise Physics to the populace and the promotion of Chartered status for eligible persons.

He is currently studying with the [[Open University]] and a local college for various Business and Electrical Inspection qualifications.
