'''Lorna Arnold''' [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (7 December 1915 – 25 March 2014) was a British historian who wrote a number of books connected with the British [[nuclear weapons]] programmes.<ref>{{cite web|first=Brian |last=Cathcart |url=http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/mar/27/lorna-arnold |title=Lorna Arnold obituary &#124; Environment |publisher=The Guardian |date=1915-12-07 |accessdate=2014-03-28}}</ref>

As the second official historian of the British nuclear weapons programmes, she had access to previously secret documents and personally knew many of the people involved the work of the [[UKAEA]]. In her old age she was still an active participant in intelligence/historical community debate,  as evinced by her contributions to meetings such the Oxford Intelligence Group in 17 June 2008.

==Early years==
Lorna Arnold was born Lorna Rainbow in London on December 7, 1915.   Her parents were Kenneth and Lorna Rainbow (née
Dawson). Arnold was the eldest of five children. Her father served in [[World War I]], and after the war, the family turned to farming in Surrey. She attended Waumborough Primary School and became the first girl in her village to win a scholarship to secondary school, and the first in that school to win a scholarship to university.<ref name=dt>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/10807672/Lorna-Arnold-obituary.html|title=Lorna Arnold - obituary|work=Daily Telegraph|date=4 May 2014|accessdate=6 May 2014}}</ref>  She graduated from [[Bedford College, London]] in 1937.<ref name="arnold2012">{{cite book |last=Arnold |first=Lorna |year=2012 |title=My Short Century |publisher=Cumnor Hill Books |isbn=978-0-9837029-0-0}}</ref>

After graduation, she trained as a teacher at [[Cambridge University]], and spent one year teaching in secondary school. She was called to serve in the government during [[World War II]], and did not return to teaching.

==World War II, Berlin and Bizonia==
In 1940, Arnold was recruited to work in the government war effort. She first served in the [[War Office]], working as part of Army Council Secretariat. There she took on increasing responsibilities, many related to supply and logistics for the war effort. During this time, she lived in London, and like many Londoners, experienced the hazards of the German air raids on London.<ref name="arnold2012"/>

In 1944, she transferred to the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] as their first woman diplomat and worked on the [[European Advisory Commission]] (EAC), making arrangements for the postwar administration of Germany.  In August 1945, Arnold was posted to  Berlin as part of the [[Allied Control Council]], a hazardous undertaking just after the fall of Germany. She reports that for a time, she slept with a pistol under her pillow during the turbulent times just after the fall of Berlin.<ref name="arnold2012"/>

After World War II, Germany was divided into four zones, managed by the British, American, French and Russians. (See [[Allied-occupied Germany]] for more details.) Berlin was also divided into four zones, and Arnold worked with her counterparts from France, the US and Russia to coordinate administering the districts and supplying foods to the population. Britain had very limited resources at the end of World War II, and in 1946, Britain and the US agreed to administer their districts jointly, under a scheme called [[Bizonia]].

In 1946, Arnold transferred to British Embassy in Washington, D.C., and worked with Americans to administer Bizonia. During her time in Washington, she had a desk at [[the Pentagon]]. She served in Washington at the same time as noted spy [[Donald Maclean (spy)|Donald Maclean]]. In 1949, she returned to England.<ref name="arnold2012"/>

==Marriage and Family==
In 1949, she married Robert Arnold, an American musician and recording engineer, whom she had met in Washington, DC.  She had two sons, Geoffrey and Stephen Arnold. In 1955, her husband returned to the United States, and she became a single parent.<ref name="arnold2012"/>  She returned to work, and after a variety of jobs, including a brief stint at a biscuit factory, she joined the [[UKAEA]] in 1959.

==United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA)==
Arnold joined the [[United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority]] in 1959,<ref name=iop>{{cite web|url=http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0952-4746/20/3/001|title=The Windscale accident - some memories and reflections|work=IOP:Journal of Radiological Protection:volume 20 Number3|author=Lorna Arnold|date=2000|accessdate=6 May 2014}}</ref> and worked on the Windscale Accident Commission. Later, she would write a book about the [[Windscale accident]],'' Windscale 1957: Anatomy of a Nuclear Accident (Basingstoke, Macmillan, 1992)''. In the AHSB her first job was as a joint secretary of a committee on training in radiological protection, set up as a result
of the Windscale accident. At the AHSB she worked for the first UKAEA Director of Health and Safety, Dr
Andrew MacLean,<ref name=iop/> who had been the Chief Medical Officer at Risley during the
Windscale Fire and was to become the first Director of the National Radiological
Protection Board on its formation in 1971.

In 1967 Arnold joined the UKAEA Historian's Office, initially working with the official historian,
[[Margaret Gowing]], who was then at the University of Kent at Canterbury. Lorna jointly
authored the second part of the UKAEA official history with Professor Gowing,<ref name="arnold2012"/>
who became Regius Professor of the History of Science at Oxford. The monumental two
volume treatise, “Independence and Deterrence: Britain and Atomic Energy,
1945-1952”, which examined in detail the policy and execution of the UK atomic
bomb project during 1945-1952 – the official history of the development and
production of the first atomic bombs in this country was published in 1974. “Independence and
Deterrence” is still in print today.

Eventually Arnold took over the role of official historian of the UKAEA, and wrote various books and
articles on British nuclear programs, both civil and military. She worked at the
UKAEA sites in London, [[Harwell]], and [[Aldermaston]], but her collaborations with
American, European, and - eventually - Russian scientists and historians took her
all over the world, from Vienna to Los Alamos.

==Honors==
In 1976, Arnold was honored as an Officer of the [[Order of the British Empire]] (OBE).
She was a Fellow of the [[Institute of Physics]] and a Fellow of the [[Institute of
Contemporary British History]]. She was a recipient of an Honorary
Fellowship of the [[Society for Radiological Protection]].

In 2009, she received an honorary Doctorate of Letters from the [[University of Reading]], for her work in nuclear history.<ref>[http://www.reading.ac.uk/news-and-events/releases/PR259644.aspx University of Reading Press Release, Dec 2009 Pres]</ref>

Though she retired from UKAEA, Arnold remained an active contributor to journals. She revised her book on the Windscale accident and contributed to others' work.

== Other Activities ==
Arnold was first introduced to [[Scilla Elworthy]], one of the leaders of the [[Oxford Research Group]], one of the UK’s leading of advocates for alternatives to global conflict, in the 1980s by her friend, physicist [[Rudolf Peierls]]. She was active in the movement for the nuclear freeze.  She participated in a series of video presentations on issues of nuclear weapons and energy for [http://www.talkworks.info Talkworks], an organization focused on dangers associated with nuclear weapons.

She also worked with television productions, including a BBC show on Windcale in 2007.

In 2012, Arnold, at age 96, published her memoirs, entitled ''''My Short Century''', in which she describes her remarkable life from living on a rural farm, to friendships  with noted figures in the world of nuclear research and development such as [[William Penney]], [[Christopher Hinton, Baron Hinton of Bankside|Christopher Hinton]] and [[Rudolf Peierls]].
