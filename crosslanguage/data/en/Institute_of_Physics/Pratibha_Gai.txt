'''Pratibha L. Gai''' is Professor and Chair of [[Electron Microscopy]] and Director at The York JEOL Nanocentre (Departments of Chemistry and Physics, [[University of York]], United Kingdom)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.york.ac.uk/physics/people/gai/ |title=Pratibha Gai - Physics, The University of York |publisher=York.ac.uk |accessdate=2013-05-13}}</ref>

== Scientific career ==

In 2009, after years of development, Gai, who holds a chair in [[electron microscopy]] and is co-director of the York JEOL Nanocentre at the [[University of York]], succeeded in creating a [[microscope]] capable of perceiving chemical reactions at the atomic scale.<ref name="THE">{{cite news|last=Gibney|first=Elizabeth|title=Pratibha Gai’s award-winning focus|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/pratibha-gais-award-winning-focus/2001487.article|newspaper=Times Higher Education|date=14 February 2013}}</ref> This is an advance on conventional microscopes at this scale, which can only view innate material in the “dead” conditions of a vacuum at room temperature.

With the help of colleagues, she built and refined the machine over two decades, beginning with a lower-resolution prototype when she was a postdoctoral researcher at the [[University of Oxford]]. She then spent 18 years in the US at chemical firm DuPont and the [[University of Delaware]].<ref name="THE"/>

Originally from India, Prof Gai has a PhD in Physics ([[Cambridge University]]), [[Cavendish Laboratory]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fwis2013.com/wp-content/uploads/pdfs/LAUREATES_EN_PROFILES.pdf |title=Professor Pratibha L.
