de Waele was born in [[Islington]], [[London]], in 1887, the son of a [[Belgian]] father and [[French people|French]] mother.

In 1914 he married a Frenchwoman<!--name not given in obituary--> with whom he had two sons, and the same year was conscripted into the [[Royal Flying Corps]].<ref name=Obit>''Chemistry and Industry'', May 13, 1967, page 777 Obituary; Armand de Waele (1887-1966)</ref>

After the [[First World War]] he joined [[Gestetner]] as Chief Research Chemist, where he remained till 1957 when he retired.  During this period he published 30 papers on rheology and patents on duplicating as well as a book.<ref name=Obit/>  He was a Fellow of the [[Royal Institute of Chemistry]] and of the [[Institute of Physics]].<ref name=deWaele1956>A. de Waele, F.R.I.C., F.Inst.P., (1956) ''Journal of the Society of Cosmetic Chemists'', 7 (4) p336</ref>
