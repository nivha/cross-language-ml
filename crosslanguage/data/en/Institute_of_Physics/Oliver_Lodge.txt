== Life ==

Oliver Lodge was born in 1851 at [[Penkhull]] in what is now [[Stoke-on-Trent]], and educated at [[Adams' Grammar School]], [[Newport, Shropshire]].  He was the eldest of eight sons and a daughter of Oliver Lodge (1826–1884) – later a [[ball clay]] merchant<ref group="note" >Purbeck Blue Clay, as it was then known, according to [http://www.pmmmg.org/History.htm].</ref> at [[Wolstanton]], [[Staffordshire]] – and his wife, Grace, née Heath (1826–1879).<ref>Oliver and Grace Lodge are buried in St. Thomas Church Yard, Penkhull according to [http://www.thepotteries.org/focus/003.htm this web site].</ref> Sir Oliver's siblings included [[Sir Richard Lodge]] (1855–1936), historian; [[Eleanor Constance Lodge]] (1869–1936), historian and principal of [[Westfield College]], London; and [[Alfred Lodge]] (1854–1937), mathematician.

In 1865, Lodge, at the age of 14, entered his father's business (Oliver Lodge & Son) as an agent for B. Fayle & Co selling [[Purbeck Ball Clay|Purbeck blue clay]] to the potteries, travelling as far as Scotland.  He continued to assist his father until he reached the age of 22. His father's wealth obtained from selling Purbeck ball clay enabled Lodge to attend physics lectures in London and attend the local Wedgwood Institute.

Lodge obtained a Bachelor of Science degree from the [[University of London]] in 1875 and a Doctor of Science in 1877.  He was appointed professor of physics and mathematics at [[University College, Liverpool]] in 1881. In 1900 Lodge moved from Liverpool back to the Midlands and became the first principal of the new [[Birmingham University]], remaining there until his retirement in 1919.  He oversaw the start of the move of the university from Edmund Street in the city centre to its present [[Edgbaston]] campus. Lodge was awarded the [[Rumford Medal]] of the [[Royal Society]] in 1898 and was knighted by [[King Edward VII]] in 1902. In 1928 he was made [[Freedom of the City|Freeman]] of his native city, Stoke-on-Trent.

Lodge married Mary Fanny Alexander Marshall at St George's church, [[Newcastle-under-Lyme]] in 1877.  They had twelve children, six boys and six girls: [[Oliver W F Lodge|Oliver William Foster]] (1878–1955), Francis Brodie (1880–1967), [[Alexander Lodge|Alec]] (1881–1938), Lionel (1883–1948), Noel (1885–1962), Violet (1888–1924), Raymond (1889–1915), Honor (1891–1979), Lorna (1892–1987), Norah (1894–1990), Barbara (1896–1983), and Rosalynde (1896–1983). Four of his sons went into business using Lodge's inventions.  Brodie and Alec created the Lodge Plug Company, which manufactured [[spark plug|sparking plug]]s for cars and aeroplanes.  Lionel and Noel founded a company that produced an electrostatic device for cleaning factory and smelter smoke in 1913, called the Lodge Fume Deposit Company Limited (changed in 1919 to Lodge Fume Company Limited and in 1922, through agreement with the International Precipitation Corporation of California, to [[Lodge Cottrell Ltd]]). [[Oliver W F Lodge|Oliver]], the eldest son, became a poet and author.

After his retirement in 1920, Sir Oliver and Lady Lodge settled in Normanton House, near Lake in [[Wiltshire]], just a few miles from [[Stonehenge]]. Lodge and his wife are buried at St. Michael’s Church, [[Wilsford, Wiltshire|Wilsford]] (Lake), Wiltshire.<ref>{{Find a Grave|13562269|Oliver Joseph Lodge}}</ref><ref>For a photo of his gravesite, see {{cite web | title = Sir Oliver Joseph Lodge | url = http://people.clarkson.edu/~ekatz/scientists/lodge.html | accessdate = 1 July 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080621123653/http://people.clarkson.edu/~ekatz/scientists/lodge.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 21 June 2008}}</ref> Their eldest son [[Oliver W F Lodge|Oliver]] and eldest daughter Violet are buried at the same church.

==Accomplishments==

[[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell's]] "''Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism''" appeared in 1873 and by 1876 Lodge was studying it intently. But he was fairly limited in mathematical physics both by aptitude and training and his first two papers were a description of a mechanism (of beaded strings and pulleys) that could serve to illustrate electrical phenomena such as conduction and polarization. Indeed, Lodge is probably best known for his advocacy and elaboration of Maxwell's [[luminiferous aether|aether]] theory – a later deprecated model postulating a wave-bearing medium filling all space. He explained his views on the aether in "''Modern Views of Electricity''" (1889) and continued to defend those ideas well into the twentieth century ("''Ether and Reality''", 1925).

As early as 1879 Lodge became interested in generating (and detecting) electromagnetic waves, something Maxwell had never considered. This interest continued throughout the 1880s but three obstacles slowed Lodge's progress. First, he thought in terms of generating light waves with their very high frequencies rather than radio waves with their much lower frequencies. Second, his good friend [[George FitzGerald]] (on whom Lodge depended for theoretical guidance) assured him (incorrectly) that "ether waves could not be generated electromagnetically."<ref>Hunt, Bruce J. (2005) ''The Maxwellians''. Ithaca: Cornell University Press. p. 37. ISBN 0801482348.</ref> FitzGerald later corrected his error but by 1881 Lodge had assumed a teaching position at University College, Liverpool the demands of which limited his time and his energy for research. And so it was [[Heinrich Hertz]] in Germany who was the first to demonstrate the transmission of electromagnetic waves in 1888.

Lodge carried out scientific investigations on [[lightning]], the source of the electromotive force in the voltaic cell, [[electrolysis]], and the application of [[electricity]] to the dispersal of fog and smoke. {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Lodge simulated lightning by discharging Leyden jars. When he attached a long wire to a Leyden jar in a darkened room, he noted a glow at intervals along the wire, evidence that he was observing electromagnetic waves. Lodge performed these experiments at the same time that Hertz was investigating the propagation of electromagnetic waves in free space.<ref>Rowlands, Peter (1990) ''Oliver Lodge and the Liverpool Physics Society''. Liverpool: Liverpool University Press. p. 23. ISBN 0853230277.</ref>

On 14 August 1894, at a meeting of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] at Oxford University, Lodge gave a lecture on the work of Hertz (recently deceased). There he conducted a demonstration of Hertzian (radio) based wireless telegraphy, transmitting messages between two buildings, showing their potential for communication.<ref>Lodge, Oliver J (1932). ''Past Years: An Autobiography'', New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, page 231.</ref>  This was one year before [[Guglielmo Marconi|Marconi]] stated demonstrating his system for radio wireless telegraphy.

Many people in the [[Victorian era]]  including [[Charles Dickens]] firmly believed in [[telepathy]]. Lodge thought that [[Mentalism|mind reading]] might be a form of communication through the [[Aether (classical element)|ether]], rather like [[radio waves]]. His adherence to [[spiritualism]] (explained below) would cause the estimation of his work by his scientific contemporaries to plummet spectacularly.

Only recently has  full credit has been given to his patent, which he called '[[Tuner (radio)|synchronicity]]' and which was purchased and [[Plagiarism|plagiarized]] by [[Marconi]] who employed him as a consultant.<ref>{{cite web

Previously, on 25 June 1995, the Royal Society had recognized this scientific achievement at a special ceremony at Oxford University.{{#tag:ref|Present at the ceremony were three of Lodge's grandsons, Oliver Raymond Wynlane Lodge, [[Tom Lodge|Thomas Odoard Marshall Lodge]], and Colin William Uppington Lodge; three of his great grandsons, Brodie Barton Odoard Lodge, Owen Barnaby Lodge and [[David Trotman|David John Angelo Trotman]]; the President of the Royal Society, Sir [[Michael Atiyah]]; Dr Peter Rowlands and Dr J. Patrick Wilson.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}|group=note}} In 1894 he attempted to detect radio emission from the [[Sun]], but his apparatus was not sensitive enough and the experiment would have been ruined by electrical interference from [[Liverpool]] in any case.<ref name="Hey" >{{Cite book

Lodge improved [[Edouard Branly]]'s coherer radio wave detector by adding the "decoherer", a vibrator which dislodged clumped filings, thus automatically maintaining the device's sensitivity.  He worked with [[Alexander Muirhead]] on the development of wireless telegraphy, selling their patents to [[Guglielmo Marconi|Marconi]] in 1912. {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

[[File:Raymond Lodge.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Raymond Lodge (1889–1915)]]
Lodge also made a major contribution to motoring when he patented a form of electric [[spark ignition]] for the internal combustion engine (the Lodge Igniter).{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Later, two of his sons developed his ideas and in 1903 founded Lodge Bros, which eventually became known as [[Lodge Plugs Ltd]]. He also made discoveries in the field of wireless transmission.<ref>Regal, Brian. (2005). ''Radio: The Life Story of a Technology''. Greenwood. p. 21. ISBN 0-313-33167-7</ref> In 1898, Lodge gained a patent on the moving-coil [[loudspeaker]], utilizing a coil connected to a diaphragm, suspended in a strong magnetic field.<ref name="Lodge1898LoudSpeakerPatent">Lodge, (1898). British Patent 9,712/98.</ref> His "syntonic" tuner patent<ref name="Lodge1898TunerPatent"/> allowed the frequency of transmitter and receiver to be "verified with ease and certainty". This was a basic patent in the industry, unusually recognized as such when extended, and purchased and used by the Marconi Company.

In political life, Lodge was an active member of the [[Fabian Society]] and published two Fabian Tracts: Socialism & Individualism (1905) and co-authored Public Service versus Private Expenditure with [[Sidney Webb]], [[George Bernard Shaw]] and [[Sidney Ball]]. They invited him several times to lecture at the [[London School of Economics]].<ref>Jolly, W. P. (1975). ''Sir Oliver Lodge''. Fairleigh Dickinson University Press. ISBN 978-0838617038</ref>

Lodge a Spiritualist was a friend of [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], who also lost a son in World War I and was a Spiritualist. Altogether, Lodge wrote more than 40 books, about the [[afterlife]], [[Aether theories|aether]], [[theory of relativity|relativity]], and [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] theory.

In 1889 Lodge was appointed President of the Liverpool Physical Society, a position he held until 1893. The society still runs to this day, though under a student body.

==Spiritualism==

Lodge is remembered for his studies in psychical research and [[Spiritualism]]. He first began to study psychical phenomena (chiefly [[telepathy]]) in the late 1880s, was a member of [[The Ghost Club]] and served as president of the London-based [[Society for Psychical Research]] from 1901 to 1903.  After his son, Raymond, was killed in [[World War I]] in 1915 he visited several mediums and wrote about the experience in a number of books, including the best-selling ''Raymond or Life and Death'' (1916).<ref>Brown, Callum G. (2006). ''Religion and Society in Twentieth-Century Britain''. Longman. p. 104. ISBN 978-0582472891</ref>

Lodge was a Christian Spiritualist. In 1909 he published the book ''Survival of Man'' which expressed his belief that [[Afterlife|life after death]] had been demonstrated by [[mediumship]]. His most controversial book was ''Raymond or Life and Death'' (1916). The book documented the [[séance]]s that he and his wife had attended with the medium [[Gladys Osborne Leonard]]. Lodge was convinced that his son Raymond had communicated with him and the book is a description of his son's experiences in the [[Spirit world (Spiritualism)|spirit world]].<ref>Kollar, Rene (2000). ''Searching for Raymond''. Lexington Books. pp. 9–10. ISBN 978-0739101612</ref> According to the book Raymond had reported that people who had died were still the same people when they passed over, there were houses, trees and flowers and the Spirit world looked similar to earth but there is no disease. The book also claimed that when soldiers died in World War I they had smoked cigars and received whisky in the spirit world and because of such statements the book was criticised.<ref>Byrne, Georgina (2010) ''Modern Spiritualism and the Church of England, 1850–1939''. Boydell Press. pp. 75–79. ISBN 978-1843835899</ref> Walter Cook wrote a rebuttal to Lodge ''Reflections on Raymond'' (1917) that directly challenged Lodge's beliefs in Spiritualism.<ref>Emden, Richard  (2012). ''The Quick and the Dead''. Bloomsbury Paperbacks. p. 201. ISBN 978-1408822456</ref>

Although Lodge was convinced that Leonard's spirit control "Feda" had communicated with his son, he admitted a good deal of the information was nonsense and suggested that Feda picked it up from a séance sitter. [[Paul Carus]] wrote the "story of Raymond's communications rather excels all prior tales of mediumistic lore in the silliness of its revelations. But the saddest part of it consists in the fact that a great scientist, no less a one than Sir Oliver Lodge, has published the book and so stands sponsor for it."<ref>[[Paul Carus|Carus, Paul]]. (1917). [http://www.jstor.org/stable/27900642 ''Sir Oliver Lodge on Life After Death'']. ''[[The Monist]]'', Vol. 27, No. 2. pp. 316-319.</ref> 

Scientific work on [[electromagnetic radiation]] convinced Lodge that an [[Luminiferous aether|ether]] existed and that it filled the entire universe. Lodge came to believe that the spirit world existed in the ether. As a Christian Spiritualist, Lodge had written that the [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]] in the Bible referred to Christ's [[etheric body]] becoming visible to his disciples after the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]].<ref>[[Peter J. Bowler|Bowler, Peter J.]] (2001). ''Reconciling Science and Religion: The Debate in Early-Twentieth-Century Britain''. University Of Chicago Press. pp. 49–50. ISBN 978-0226068589</ref> By the 1920s the physics of the ether had been undermined by the [[theory of relativity]], however, Lodge still defended his ether theory and rejected relativity.<ref>Perlick, Volker (2000). ''Ray Optics, Fermat's Principle, and Applications to General Relativity''. Springer. p. 201. ISBN 978-3540668985</ref> Linked to his belief in Spiritualism, Lodge had also endorsed a theory of [[spiritual evolution]] which he promoted in ''Man and the Universe'' (1908) and ''Making of Man'' (1924).<ref>[[Peter J. Bowler|Bowler, Peter J.]]. (2009). ''Science For All: The Popularization of Science in Early Twentieth-Century''. University Of Chicago Press. p. 44. ISBN 978-0226068633</ref> He lectured on [[theistic evolution]] at the Charing Cross Hospital and at Christ Church, Westminster. His lectures were published in a book ''Evolution and Creation'' (1926).<ref>The Bookman: A Review of Books and Life. Volume 64. Dodd, Mead. 1926. p. 104.</ref>

The Spiritualist beliefs and publications of Lodge sold well to the public but were not accepted by the scientific community.<ref>Oppenheim, Janet (1988). ''The Other World: Spiritualism and Psychical Research in England, 1850–1914''. Cambridge University Press. p. 482. ISBN 978-0739101612</ref> In 1913 the biologist [[Ray Lankester]] criticised the Spiritualist views of Lodge as unscientific and misleading the public.<ref>[[Peter J. Bowler|Bowler, Peter J.]] (2001). ''Reconciling Science and Religion: The Debate in Early-Twentieth-Century Britain''. University Of Chicago Press. p. 64.

(1914). ''The Religion of Sir Oliver Lodge''. Watts & Co.</ref>

[[Edward Clodd]] criticized Lodge as being an incompetent researcher to detect fraud and claimed his Spiritualist beliefs were based on [[magical thinking]] and primitive superstition.<ref>[[Edward Clodd|Clodd, Edward]]. (1917). [https://archive.org/stream/questionifmandie00cloduoft#page/265/mode/2up ''The Question: A Brief History and Examination of Modern Spiritualism]''. Grant Richards, London. pp. 265–301</ref> [[Charles Arthur Mercier]] a specialist in [[insanity]] wrote in his book ''Spiritualism and Sir Oliver Lodge'' (1917) that Lodge had been duped into believing mediumship by trickery and his Spiritualist views were based on assumptions and not scientific evidence.<ref>[[Charles Arthur Mercier|Mercier, Charles Arthur]]. (1917). [https://archive.org/stream/spiritualismsiro00mercuoft#page/n3/mode/2up ''Spiritualism and Sir Oliver Lodge'']. London: Mental Culture Enterprise.</ref> Francis Jones in the ''[[American Journal of Psychology]]'' in a review for Lodge's ''The Survival of Man'' wrote it's psychical claims are not scientific and the book is one-sided as it does not contain research from [[experimental psychology]].<ref>Francis Jones. (1910). ''The Survival of Man; A Study in Unrecognized Human Faculty by Oliver Lodge''. The American Journal of Psychology, Vol. 21, No. 3. p. 505.</ref>

According to the magician [[John Booth (magician)|John Booth]] the stage mentalist [[David Devant]] managed to fool a number of people into believing he had genuine [[psychic]] ability who did not realize that his feats were magic tricks. At [[St. George's Hall, London]] he performed a fake "clairvoyant" act where he would read a message sealed inside an envelope. Oliver Lodge who was present in the audience was duped by the trick and claimed that Devant had used psychic powers. In 1936 Devant in his book ''Secrets of My Magic'' revealed the trick method he had used.<ref>[[John Booth (magician)|Booth, John]]. (1986). ''Psychic Paradoxes''. Prometheus Books. pp. 15–16. ISBN 978-0879753580</ref>

==Tributes==

Lodge received the honorary [[Legum Doctor|Doctor of Laws]] (LL.D) from the [[University of Glasgow]] in June 1901.<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Glasgow University jubilee |day_of_week=Friday |date=14 June 1901 |page_number=10 |issue=36481}}</ref>

The author of his obituary in ''[[The Times]]'' wrote:

''Always an impressive figure, tall and slender with a pleasing voice and charming manner, he enjoyed the affection and respect of a very large circle…''

''Lodge’s gifts as an expounder of knowledge were of a high order, and few scientific men have been able to set forth abstruse facts in a more lucid or engaging form… Those who heard him on a great occasion, as when he gave his [[Romanes lecture]] at Oxford or his [[British Association]] presidential address at Birmingham, were charmed by his alluring personality as well as impressed by the orderly development of his [[thesis]]. But he was even better in informal debate, and when he rose, the audience, however perplexed or jaded, settled down in a pleased expectation that was never disappointed.''<ref>Obituary in ''The Times'', Friday 23 August 1940 (page 7, column 4)</ref>

Oliver Lodge Primary School in [[Vanderbijlpark]], [[South Africa]] is named in his honour.

Lodge is commemorated in a bronze figure entitled ''Education'', at the base of the [[Victoria Monument (Liverpool)|Queen Victoria Monument]] in [[Liverpool]].<ref>[http://www.victorianweb.org/sculpture/allen/3.html ''Queen Victoria Monument''] The Victorian Web</ref>
