Superposition is a programme commissioned by the [[Institute of Physics]] in London. It is, in 2013, in its first year and a large installation is planned in an underground space beneath the [[London Canal Museum]] in King's Cross, London. The site is a former ice well constructed around 1863 for the storage of imported natural ice, that is not normally open to the public. The artist [[Lyndall Phelps]], inspired by the work of particle physicist Dr. [[Ben Still]], has designed a large structure consisting of concentric rings in a framework suspended from the soffit, from which hang strings of disks. The disks are of clear plastic but they are fitted with coloured beads and diamantes. The disks are connected by small brass rods. The specific artwork in the ice well has the title "Covariance".

It is the provisional plan of the Institute to commission further installations of art inspired by physics in the future.

Special arrangements have been made between the Institute and the London Canal Museum to enable members of the public to visit the underground site and see the artwork in August, September, and October 2013.

Superposition is notable for its rare combination of art, physics, and industrial heritage. Physicists conduct some of their experiments under ice, and underground. This is the link to the heritage of the ice wells. The work of art itself is the result of an unusual collaboration between an artist and a physicist.<ref>Institute of Physics, [http://www.physics.org/superposition "Superposition Blog"], ''The Institute of Physics'', August 2013</ref><ref>London Canal Museum, [http://www.canalmuseum.org.uk/superposition "Superposition Information"], ''The London Canal Museum'', August 2013</ref>
