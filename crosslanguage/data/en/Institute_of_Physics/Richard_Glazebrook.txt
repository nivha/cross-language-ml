'''Sir Richard Tetley Glazebrook''' [[Order of the Bath|KCB]] [[Royal Victorian Order|KCVO]] [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]]<ref name="frs">{{cite doi|10.1098/rsbm.1936.0004}}</ref> (18 September 1854 – 15 December 1935) was an [[England|English]] [[physicist]].<ref>{{cite doi|10.1093/ref:odnb/33422}}</ref>

==Education and early career==
Glazebrook was born in [[West Derby]], [[Liverpool]], the son of a [[surgeon]]. He was educated at [[Dulwich College]] until 1870, [[Liverpool College]] from 1870 to 1872, and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], from which he graduated in [[Mathematics]] in 1876 and of which he was elected a [[fellow]] in 1877.<ref>{{acad|id=GLSK872RT|name=Glazebrook, Richard Tetley}}</ref> He studied [[physics]] under [[James Clerk Maxwell]] and [[John Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh|Lord Rayleigh]] at the new [[Cavendish Laboratory]] and in 1880 was appointed a demonstrator at the laboratory. The following year he was also appointed a college lecturer in mathematics and physics and a university lecturer in mathematics. His research focused on electrical standards and aviation.

==Later career==
He hoped to succeed Rayleigh as [[Cavendish Professor of Physics]] in 1884, but was surprisingly (given that he was also Rayleigh's choice) passed over in favour of [[J. J. Thomson|Sir J. J. Thomson]], which was a great disappointment to him. He was, however, appointed Assistant Director of the Cavendish in 1891 and [[Bursar]] of Trinity College in 1895. In 1898 he was appointed Principal of [[University College, Liverpool]].

In June 1899, however, he left to become first Director of the [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory]] in [[Teddington]]. He held the post until his retirement (largely due to friction with the [[Department of Scientific and Industrial Research]]) in 1919, successfully establishing the NPL as a world leader in physics research.

==Retirement==
Following his retirement, he moved back to [[Cambridge]] and edited the ''[[Dictionary of Applied Physics]]''. From 1920 to 1923 he was [[Zaharoff Professor of Aviation]] and Director of the Department of Aeronautics at [[Imperial College, London]]. He remained on the General Board of the NPL and chaired the Executive Committee from 1925 to 1932.

==Honours and awards==
In 1882 he was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] (FRS)<ref name="frs"/> at the very young age of 28. He served as Vice-President of the Royal Society in 1919–1920 and 1924–1928 and as its Foreign Secretary from 1926 to 1929. He was awarded the [[Hughes Medal]] in 1909 and the [[Royal Medal]] in 1931. He was also awarded the [[Albert Medal (RSA)|Albert Medal]] of the [[Royal Society of Arts]] in 1918 and the Gold Medal of the [[Royal Aeronautical Society]] in 1933. He was President of the [[Physical Society]], later the [[Institute of Physics]], from 1903 to 1905 and president of the [[Institution of Electrical Engineers]] in 1906.

Glazebrook was appointed [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] (CB) in 1910, was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in 1917, and appointed [[Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath]] (KCB) in the 1920 New Year War Honours<ref>{{LondonGazette |issue=31713 |date=30 December 1919 |startpage=1 |supp=yes}}</ref> and [[Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order]] (KCVO) in 1934.

==Personal life==
He married Frances Gertrude Atkinson of [[Leeds]] in 1883; they had a son and three daughters. He died at [[Limpsfield]], [[Surrey]].
