He entered [[Raine's Foundation School]] in 1936 as the middle of three brothers, leaving in 1943 after being accepted into [[University College London]], where he did his BSc. In 1945 he joined the Royal Naval Scientific Service, moving in 1947 to the [[Admiralty Research Laboratory]].<ref name="fp"/> In 1950 he transferred again to the Services Electronics Research Laboratory (SERL) where he remained until 1964 before again moving, this time to the [[Royal Radar Establishment]].<ref name="fp"/> He won the Welker Award in 1978,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iscs2007.org/index.php?Awards|title=Awards - ISCS2007|accessdate=2008-11-13}}</ref> was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering]], a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1979 and an honorary member of the American [[National Academy of Engineering]].<ref name="fp"/> In 1983 he was appointed Director of Research at [[Hirst Research Centre|GEC Hirst Research Centre]]. He was awarded the [[Max Born Prize]] in 1987, the 1988 [[Faraday Medal]], and from then until 1990 served as President of the [[Institute of Physics]]. In the 1990 [[Queen's Birthday Honours]] he was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE)<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=52173|startpage=7|endpage=8|date=15 June 1990|accessdate=2008-11-17}}</ref> for "services to the Electrical and Electronics Industry".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.npg.org.uk/live/search/person.asp?LinkID=mp06516|title=Cyril Hilsum (1925-) Physicist|accessdate=2008-11-13}}</ref> He was the subject of a photograph by [[Nick Sinclair]] in 1993 that is currently held by the [[National Portrait Gallery (London)|National Portrait Gallery]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.npg.org.uk/live/search/portrait.asp?LinkID=mp06516&rNo=0&role=sit|title=NPG P564(10) Cyril Hilsum|accessdate=2008-11-13}}</ref> In 1997 he was awarded the Glazebrook Medal and Prize from the Institute of Physics, and is notable as the only scientist to hold both this and the Faraday Medal together.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://malvernscienceservices.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=91:professor-cyril-hilsum-cbe&catid=48:our-team&Itemid=89|title=Professor Cyril Hilsum CBE|accessdate=2008-11-13}}</ref> He has served as a corporate research advisor for various entities, including Cambridge Display Technology, the [[European Commission]] and [[Unilever]].

==Research==
While working for the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] Hilsum helped develop commercial applications for [[gallium arsenide]], and was responsible for creating the UK's first semiconductor laser. He was one of the developers of the 
[[Ridley Watkins Hilsum theory|Ridley-Watkins-Hilsum theory]] that provided the theoretical basis of the [[Gunn diode]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mwrf.com/Articles/Print.cfm?ArticleID=19913|title=CYRIL HILSUM|accessdate=2008-11-13}}</ref> and his research helped form the basis of modern [[LCD]] technology,<ref>[http://www.lcd-displays-manufacturers.com/suserfiles/upload/lcd_history_blaze_display.pdf The history of liquid-crystal displays], Hirohisa Kawamoto, Proceedings of the IEEE, Vol. 90, No. 4, April 2002</ref> bringing in over Â£100m to the UK government. The [[British Liquid Crystal Society]] awards a Cyril Hilsum Medal each year "to British candidates for overall contributions to liquid-crystal science and technology. The award is made to mid-career scientists who have made notable contributions to the subject over a number of years."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/news-articles/0804/08043004|title=Cyril Hilsum Medal awarded|accessdate=2008-11-13}}</ref>
