'''Peter Ware Higgs''' {{small|[[Companion of Honour|CH]] [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] [[Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|FRSE]]}} (born 29 May 1929) is a [[British people|British]] [[Theoretical physics|theoretical physicist]], [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Prize]] laureate and [[emeritus professor]] at the [[University of Edinburgh]].<ref name=Edit>Griggs, Jessica (Summer 2008) [http://www.ed.ac.uk/polopoly_fs/1.6732!/fileManager/edit-summer-08.pdf The Missing Piece] ''Edit'' the University of Edinburgh Alumni Magazine, p. 17</ref>

He is best known for his 1960s proposal of [[broken symmetry]] in [[electroweak theory]], explaining the origin of [[mass]] of [[elementary particles]] in general and of the [[W and Z bosons]] in particular. This so-called [[Higgs mechanism]], which was proposed by several physicists besides Higgs at about the same time, predicts the existence of a new particle, the [[Higgs boson]] (which was often described as "the most sought-after particle in modern physics"<ref>Griffiths, Martin (1 May 2007) [http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/print/27731 physicsworld.com The Tale of the Blog's Boson] Retrieved on 27 May 2008</ref><ref>Fermilab Today (16 June 2005)  [http://www.fnal.gov/pub/today/archive_2005/today05-06-16.html Fermilab Results of the Week.

==Early life and education==
Higgs was born in the [[Elswick, Tyne and Wear|Elswick]] district of [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], England, to an English father and Scottish mother.<ref name = CV>Staff (29 November 2012) [http://www.ph.ed.ac.uk/higgs/peter-higgs Peter Higgs: Curriculum Vitae] The University of Edinburgh, School of Physics and Astronomy, Retrieved 9 January 2012</ref><ref name=Guardian>Sample, Ian.

BBC.</ref> His father worked as a sound engineer for the BBC, and as a result of childhood asthma, together with the family moving around because of his father's job and later [[World War II]], Higgs missed some early schooling and was taught at home. When his father relocated to [[Bedford]], Higgs stayed behind with his mother in [[Bristol]], and was largely raised there. He attended [[Cotham Grammar School]] in Bristol from 1941–46,<ref name =CV/><ref>The Cotham Grammar School, a High-Performing Specialist Co-operative Academy [http://www.cotham.bristol.sch.uk/news/default.asp?storyID=208, The Dirac-Higgs Science Centre] Retrieved 10 January 2013</ref> where he was inspired by the work of one of the school's [[Alumnus|alumni]], [[Paul Dirac]], a founder of the field of [[quantum mechanics]].<ref name=Guardian/>

In 1946, at the age of 17, Higgs moved to [[City of London School]], where he specialized in mathematics, then in 1947 to [[King's College London]] where he graduated with a first class honours degree in Physics in 1950 and achieved a master's degree in 1952. He was awarded an [[1851 Research Fellowship]] from the [[Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851]],<ref>1851 Royal Commission Archives</ref>  and studied for his doctorate in molecular physics under the supervision of [[Charles Coulson]] and [[H. Christopher Longuet-Higgins|Christopher Longuet-Higgins]].

==Research career==

===Work in theoretical physics===
At Edinburgh Higgs first became interested in [[mass]], developing the idea that particles – massless when the universe began – acquired mass a fraction of a second later as a result of interacting with a theoretical field (which became known as the [[Higgs field]]). Higgs postulated that this field permeates space, giving mass to all elementary subatomic particles that interact with it.<ref name=Guardian/><ref name=EB>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9040396/Higgs-particle "Higgs particle"], ''Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2007.
</ref>

The [[Higgs mechanism]] postulates the existence of the Higgs field which confers mass on quarks and leptons.<ref>{{Cite doi |10.1007/s12045-012-0110-z}}</ref> However this causes only a tiny portion of the masses of other subatomic particles, such as protons and neutrons. In these, gluons that bind quarks together confer most of the particle mass.

The original basis of Higgs' work came from the Japanese-born theorist and [[Nobel Prize]] laureate [[Yoichiro Nambu]] from the [[University of Chicago]]. Professor Nambu had proposed a theory known as [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]] based on what was known to happen in [[superconductivity]] in condensed matter; however, the theory predicted massless particles (the [[Goldstone's theorem]]), a clearly incorrect prediction.<ref name = Edit/>

Higgs is reported to have come up with the basic fundamentals of his theory after coming back to his Edinburgh [[New Town, Edinburgh|New Town]] apartment from a failed weekend camping trip to the Highlands,<ref>Martin, Victoria (14 December 2011) [http://www.scotsman.com/news/victoria-martin-soon-we-ll-be-able-to-pinpoint-that-particle-1-2007674 Soon we’ll be able to pinpoint that particle] The Scotsman, Retrieved 10 January  2013</ref><ref>

although he has also said that there was no "eureka moment" in the development of the theory.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-17161657 | work=BBC News | title=Meeting the Boson Man: Professor Peter Higgs | date=24 February 2012}}</ref> He wrote a short paper exploiting a loophole in Goldstone's theorem (massless Goldstone particles need not occur when local symmetry is spontaneously broken in a relativistic theory<ref name = HiggsMechanism/>) and published it in ''[[Physics Letters]]'', a European physics journal edited at [[CERN]], in [[Switzerland]], in 1964.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1016/0031-9163(64)91136-9}}</ref>

Higgs wrote a second paper describing a theoretical model (now called the [[Higgs mechanism]]), but the paper was rejected (the editors of ''Physics Letters'' judged it "of no obvious relevance to physics"<ref name=Guardian/>). Higgs wrote an extra paragraph and sent his paper to ''[[Physical Review Letters]]'', another leading physics journal, which published it later in 1964. This paper predicted a new massive spin-zero boson (now known as the [[Higgs Boson]]).<ref name = HiggsMechanism>Staff (5 January 2012) [http://www.ph.ed.ac.uk/higgs/brief-history Brief History of the Higgs Mechanism] The Edinburgh University School of Physics and Astronomy, Retrieved 10 January 2013</ref><ref>{{cite doi|10.1103/PhysRevLett.13.508}}</ref>

had reached similar conclusions about the same time. In the published version Higgs quotes Brout and Englert and the third paper quotes the previous ones. The three papers written on this boson discovery by Higgs, Guralnik, Hagen, Kibble, Brout, and Englert were each recognized as milestone papers by ''[[Physical Review Letters]]'' 50th anniversary celebration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://prl.aps.org/50years/milestones#1964 |title=Physical Review Letters – 50th Anniversary Milestone Papers |publisher=Prl.aps.org |date= |accessdate=5 July 2012}}</ref> While each of these famous papers took similar approaches, the contributions and differences between the [[1964 PRL symmetry breaking papers]] are noteworthy. The mechanism had been proposed in 1962 by [[Philip Warren Anderson|Philip Anderson]] although he did not include a crucial relativistic model.<ref name = HiggsMechanism/><ref>{{cite doi|10.1103/PhysRev.130.439}}</ref>

On 4 July 2012, CERN announced the [[ATLAS experiment|ATLAS]] and [[Compact Muon Solenoid|CMS]] experiments had seen strong indications for the presence of a new particle, which could be the Higgs boson, in the mass region around 126 gigaelectronvolts ([[GeV]]).<ref>

"I wish he hadn't done it," he says. "I have to explain to people it was a joke. I'm an atheist, but I have an uneasy feeling that playing around with names like that could be unnecessarily offensive to people who are religious."|location=London}}</ref> He has described [[Richard Dawkins]] as having adopted a “[[fundamentalist]]” view of non-atheists,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/9770707/Has-Richard-Dawkins-found-a-worthy-opponent-at-last.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Nigel | last=Farndale | title=Has Richard Dawkins found a worthy opponent at last? | date=29 December 2012}}</ref> (although Higgs had said that ''Dawkins in a way is almost a fundamentalist himself''). Higgs expressed later that he was displeased that the Higgs particle is nicknamed the "God particle",<ref>[http://www.reuters.com/article/scienceNews/idUSL0765287220080407?sp=true Key scientist sure "God particle" will be found soon] Reuters news story. 7 April 2008.</ref> as he believes the term "might offend people who are religious".<ref name=NS>"[http://www.newscientist.com/channel/opinion/mg19926732.100-interview-the-man-behind-the-god-particle.html Interview: the man behind the 'God particle']", [[New Scientist]] 13 Sep 2008, pp. 44–5 {{subscription required}}</ref>
Usually this nickname for the Higgs boson is attributed to [[Leon Lederman]], the author of the book ''[[The God Particle: If the Universe Is the Answer, What Is the Question?]]'', but the name is the result of the insistence of Lederman's publisher: Lederman had originally intended to refer to it as the "goddamn particle".<ref>{{Cite news |work=The Guardian |title=Father of the 'God Particle' |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2008/jun/30/higgs.boson.cern |date=30 June 2008 |first=James |last=Randerson |location=London}}</ref>
