'''Alfred Fowler''', [[CBE]] [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]]<ref name="frs">{{cite doi|10.1098/rsbm.1941.0016}}</ref> (22 March 1868 [[Yorkshire]] &ndash; 24 June 1940) was an English [[astronomer]].  Not to be confused with American astrophysicist [[William Alfred Fowler]].

He was born in Wilsden, Yorkshire and educated at London's Normal School of Science, which was later absorbed into [[Imperial College, London]]. 

He was appointed Instructor (later Assistant Professor) of Astrophysics at Imperial College and worked there until his death. He was an expert in [[spectroscopy]], being one of the first to determine that the temperature of [[sunspot]]s was cooler than that of surrounding regions.

He was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1910, when his citation read 

:"''Associate of the Royal College of Science. Assistant Professor of Physics (Astrophysics Department) Imperial College and Technology, South Kensington. Distinguished for his contributions to Astronomical Physics by spectroscopic observations of eclipses, solar pre-eminences, and sunspots, and by experimental researches bearing on their interpretation. Associated in observations of total eclipses of the sun with [[Norman Lockyer|Sir Norman Lockyer]] in 1893, 1896, 1898, 1900, and (with [[Hugh Longbourne Callendar|Prof Callendar]]) in 1905.'' "

:''He was awarded their [[Royal Medal]] in 1918 and delivered their [[Bakerian Lecture]]s in 1914 and 1924.''

Fowler was president of the [[Royal Astronomical Society]] from 1919 to 1921 and died in [[Ealing, London]] in 1940.
