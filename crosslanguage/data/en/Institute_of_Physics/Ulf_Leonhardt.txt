'''Ulf Leonhardt''', [[FRSE]] (born October 9, 1965) is a German scientist, born in Schlema, Germany (formerly East Germany). In 2006, he published the first scientific paper on [[metamaterial cloaking|invisibility cloaking]] with [[metamaterial]]s at the same time [[John Pendry|Pendry's group]] published their paper in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''. He has been involved with the science of cloaking objects since then.<ref name=bio>

He is a Wolfson Research Merit Award holder from the [[Royal Society]], and he currently holds a chair in [[theoretical physics]] at [[University of St Andrews]]. He is involved in research pertaining to metamaterials. Specific disciplines are [[quantum electrodynamics]] in media,  [[superlens|perfect imaging]], optical analogues of the [[event horizon]], [[casimir effect|reverse casimir effect]], [[metamaterial cloaking]], [[quantum effects]] of optical phenomena involving [[Hawking radiation]] and [[Light|Light in moving media]].<ref name=bio/><ref name=NJPhys11>

==Career==
In 1993, Leonhardt earned his PhD ([[theoretical physics]]) from Humboldt University.  From 1998 to 2000 he was in Stockholm at the [[Royal Institute of Technology]] as a Göran-Gustafsson Fellow. He has held the chair (theoretical physics) at St. Andrews in Scotland since April, 2000.<ref name=bio/>

===Awards and honors===
Professor Ulf Leonhardt is a Fellow of the [[Institute of Physics]]. He is also a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]]. He is a recipient of the Otto Hahn Award of the [[Max Planck Society]]. In August 2009, the Royal Society's [[Theo Murphy Blue Skies award]] allowed Leonhardt to research a new theory for applying metamaterials to optical cloaking full time.<ref name=bio/><ref name=physorg-newtheory>
