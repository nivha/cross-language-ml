'''''The Astrophysical Journal''''', often abbreviated '''''ApJ''''' (pronounced "ap jay") in references and speech,<ref>Referred to as ApJ on own Web site</ref> is a [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[scientific journal]] of [[astrophysics]], established in 1895 by American astronomers [[George Ellery Hale]] and [[James Edward Keeler]]. {{As of|2013}} it published three 900-page issues per month. 

Since 1953 '''''The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series''''' ('''''ApJS''''') has been published in conjunction with ''The Astrophysical Journal'', with generally longer articles to supplement the material in the journal. It publishes six volumes per year, with two 280-page issues per volume. 

'''''The Astrophysical Journal Letters''''' ('''''ApJL''''') is another section of ''The Astrophysical Journal'' which rapidly publishes short communications.

The journal and the supplement series were both published by the [[University of Chicago Press]] for the [[American Astronomical Society]] until, in January 2009, publication was transferred to [[IOP Publishing]],<ref>
