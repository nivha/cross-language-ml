'''Professor Allan Boardman''' is known for his work on [[Surface plasmon resonance|surface plasmons]] and [[guided wave optics]], especially [[nonlinear wave]]s, [[soliton]]s, [[Magneto-optic effect|magneto-optics]] and negative refracting [[metamaterial]]s.  He is a leading theorist and numerical analyst in these areas, especially magneto-optics and metamaterials, and was recently cited by the [[Optical Society of America]] for his seminal contributions and exemplary leadership and service to the optics community.

Allan Boardman is Professor of Applied Physics at the [[University of Salford]] and holds a Doctor of Science degree from the [[University of Durham]] UK. He is a Fellow of the UK [[Institute of Physics]] and a Fellow of the UK [[Institute of Mathematics and its Applications]]. He co-chaired the major UK photonics meeting called Photon06. He is co-chair of the [[SPIE]] Photonic Metamaterials conference series to be held in San Diego and has organized other conferences, including being a Director of a number of pivotal NATO Advanced Study Institutes. 

He is the chair of the Optics and Photonics Division of the UK [[Institute of Physics]] and is Vice-President of the United Kingdom Consortium for Optics and Photonics (UKCPO).  He is also a Board member of the Quantum Electronics and Optics Division of the [[European Physical Society]]. He is the UK voice on the new European strategy program called OPERA [Optics and Photonics in the European Research Area] 2015.
