==Life and career==
MacKay was born the fifth child of [[Donald MacCrimmon MacKay]] and Valerie MacKay. His elder brother [[Robert Sinclair MacKay|Robert S. MacKay]] FRS (born in 1956) is Professor of Mathematics at the [[University of Warwick]]. David was educated at Newcastle High School (later [[Newcastle-under-Lyme School]]) and represented Britain in the [[International Physics Olympiad]] in Yugoslavia in 1985, receiving the first prize for experimental work. He went up to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], and received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in [[Natural Sciences (Cambridge)|Natural Sciences]] (Experimental and [[theoretical physics]]) in 1988. He went to the [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech) as a [[Fulbright Scholar]]. His supervisor in the graduate programme in Computation and Neural Systems was [[John Hopfield]].<ref name="mathgene"/> He was awarded a [[PhD]] in 1992.<ref name="mackayphd">{{cite thesis|degree=PhD|first=David J.C. |last=Mackay|title= Bayesian methods for adaptive models|publisher=California Institute of Technology|date=1992|url=http://thesis.library.caltech.edu/25|authorlink=David J.

In January 1992 MacKay was made the [[Royal Society]] Smithson Research Fellow at [[Darwin College, Cambridge]], continuing his cross-disciplinary research in the [[Cavendish Laboratory]], the Department of Physics of the University of Cambridge. In 1995 he was made a University Lecturer in the Cavendish Laboratory. He was promoted in 1999 to a Readership, in 2003 to a Professorship in Natural Philosophy and in 2013 to the post of [[Regius Professor of Engineering, Cambridge University|Regius Professorship of Engineering]].<ref name=Regius>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/david-mackay-appointed-regius-professor-of-engineering |title=David MacKay appointed Regius Professor of Engineering |publisher=University of Cambridge |date=28 March 2013 |accessdate=3 April 2013}}</ref> He was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in May 2009.<ref>

==Science outreach and service==
His interests beyond research include the development of effective teaching methods and African development; he taught regularly at the [[African Institute for Mathematical Sciences]] in [[Cape Town]] from its foundation in 2003 to 2006. In 2008 he completed a book on energy consumption and energy production without [[fossil fuel]]s called  ''Sustainable Energy — Without the Hot Air''. MacKay used £10,000 of his own money to publish the book, and the initial print run of 5,000 sold within days.<ref name=guardian>{{cite news |title=Power to the People |author=Leo Hickman |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/apr/30/david-mckay-sustainable-energy |newspaper=The Guardian |date=30 April 2009 |accessdate=14 January 2011}}</ref> The book received praise from ''[[The Economist]]'',<ref>{{cite news |title=Meltdown |author= |url=http://www.economist.com/node/13437900?story_id=13437900 |newspaper=The Economist |date=8 April 2009|accessdate=14 January 2011}}</ref> ''[[The Guardian]]'',<ref name=guardian /> and [[Bill Gates]], who called it "one of the best books on energy that has been written."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thegatesnotes.com/Learning/article.aspx?ID=61|title=Clear Thinking on the Topic of Energy|author=Bill Gates|work=The Gates Notes|publisher=|date=15 January 2010|accessdate=14 January 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRQB2YXUxvY |title=YouTube - How Many Light Bulbs? with David MacKay From Cambridge Ideas‏ |work= |accessdate=28 June 2011}}</ref> Like his textbook on Information theory, MacKay makes the book available for free online.

===Appointments===
David MacKay was appointed to be Chief Scientific Advisor of the [[Department of Energy and Climate Change]], United Kingdom, in September 2009.<ref name=appointment />

==Awards and honours==
MacKay was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]] in 2009. His nomination reads:{{centered pull quote|David MacKay introduced more efficient types of error-correcting code that are now used in satellite communications, digital broadcasting and magnetic recording. He advanced the field of Machine Learning by providing a sound Bayesian foundation for artificial neural networks. Using this foundation, he significantly improved their performance, allowing them to be used for designing new types of steel that are now used in power stations. He used his expertise in information theory to design a widely-used interface called "dasher" that allows disabled people to write efficiently using a single finger or head-mounted pointer."<ref name="royal">{{cite web|url=http://royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqDb=Catalog&dsqCmd=show.tcl&dsqSearch=(RefNo==%27EC%2F2009%2F27%27)|title = Library and Archive Catalogue|publisher=The Royal Society|accessdate=2013-11-11|location=London}}</ref>}}
