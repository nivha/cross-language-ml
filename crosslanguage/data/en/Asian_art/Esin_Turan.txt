Esin Turan (born 1970 in Konya, Turkey)  is an Austrian-Turkish painter and sculptor who currently resides in Vienna. Turan consistently focuses her work on overcoming Western stereotypes of the Muslim world.

Esin Turan completed her studies at the Sculpture Department of the Arts Faculty of Hacettepe University before, in 1992, continuing her studies at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna with Professor Bruno Gironcoli.
She lives and works in Vienna, and is involved in numerous projects initiated by the City of Vienna and the EU for the purpose of bringing together young people of different cultures to work together on art
projects.

Her works focus on the concept of femininity in reflexions on society, sexuality, current events and their inner connection to the past and the effects of time and space, developing her own unique artistic mark in various modes of expression. Her works have been purchased by the Austrian Ministry of Education, Science and Arts, the City of Vienna, and various private collectors and have been exhibited in Turkey, Austria, Germany, Spain, USA and Japan.
