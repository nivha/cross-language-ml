Burak Arıkan (born in 1976, Istanbul) is a Turkish contemporary artist, who works with network structures and dynamics to explore issues in techno-politics and alternative economics. He takes the obvious social, economical, and political issues of the current capitalist society as an input and run through an abstract machinery, which generates network maps, results in performances, and procreates predictions to make inherent power relationships visible, thus discussable.

His work MyPocket (2008)  is a live software system that predicts his everyday spending and discloses his financial records to the world. MyPocket was shown in Neuberger Museum of Art New York, Künstlerhaus Bethanien Berlin, and Media Space / FilmWinter Stuttgart in 2009.

Arikan deals with human made complex systems by applying techniques such as network mapping, network analysis, programming, and protocol authoring. He also conducts network mapping workshops for artists  and civil society organizations.

Arikan is an adjunct faculty in Interactive Telecommunications Program, Tisch School of Arts, New York University.

Arikan completed his master’s degree at the MIT Media Lab in Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the Physical Language Workshop led by John Maeda.

Arikan is a member of Alternative informatics association, a civil society organization in turkey focusing on the issues of media literacy, Internet censorship, and surveillance.
