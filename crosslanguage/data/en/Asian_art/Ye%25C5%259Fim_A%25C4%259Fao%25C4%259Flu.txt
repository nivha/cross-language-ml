== Art work ==

Yeşim Ağaoğlu has concentrated on art making with performance, visual material and objects. At the beginning her poems written on yellow paper with conventional typewriter occupy the center of these works. The yellow pages are a basic material and modest elements of communication with the people, but when they are arranged in huge geometrical heaps in the exhibition spaces they also become a Fluxus installation. Her presence in the exhibition space is considered as performance, even if she does not make performance in the sense that she is directly involved into the process of the art work, but her continuous blending into the viewers attendance gives the impression of a performance. Her approach to art-making is minimalist and modest. Avoiding popularity and sophistication she describes her works as "technically simple but conceptually rich."
As a photographer Ağaoğlu journeys into the city’s simple and elaborate images, focusing on the hybrid architecture, on the human diversity, on the gender differentiations and on to the well hidden ideological symbols and manifestations. 
Being a highly sensitive artist to socio-political environment of our region, it is a necessity for her to convey her messages through particular strategies in art making; and, every time she invents new ones. She is decidedly doing well in fulfilling the prerequisites of approaching the distant public of contemporary art.

== Poetry ==

Since 1995 Yeşim Agaoğlu has produced nine magnificent poetry books that made her famous as young women poet in the literary scene of Turkey. The emphasis in her poems is on exploration of the most obscure dreams, desires and intentions of the soul and the unpredictable relations between individuals, however in between the layers of poetic descriptions she allows the reader to pass through a socio-political terrain that reflects her critical approach to the order of things. She discloses this complexity in a surrealist mode intertwined with an exhilarating openness of subject and form. Her imaginative qualities also owe much to her education in archeology and cinema.
