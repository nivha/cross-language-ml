Born and raised in Istanbul, Turkey, Gizem Saka obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in Economics from Koc University in 1999. She moved to the United States in 1999. In 2008, she received her PhD in behavioral and experimental economics from Cornell University.

While attending college, Saka started drawing and studied pottery and sculptural form. In 2000, she started taking classes at the department of Art and Architecture at Cornell University. In 2005, she had her first solo exhibition in Montreal’s Gallery Gora. Since 2005, she has been exhibiting in international venues.

As a young athlete, Saka was the Turkish national champion in gymnastics and between 1989-1993, a member of the Turkish national gymnastics team.

==Art==
Saka’s art has the decorative elements of the Middle East and the colors of the Mediterranean. Saka uses her background as a muse. Her main themes are women, reading, Ottoman period Iznik tiles and figures. In an interview, she mentioned that due to the large number of women in her family, she mainly observed feminine joys and sorrows.

Her ongoing “Women” collection includes observations of women in everyday life, either having tea, or chatting with friends, kissing their lovers, reading books, having coffee, looking at mirrors.
