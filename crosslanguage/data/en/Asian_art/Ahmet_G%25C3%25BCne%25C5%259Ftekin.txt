Ahmet Güneştekin (born December 22, 1966 in Batman, Turkey) is a Kurdish  visual artist born in Turkey, whose works span painting, conceptual art and constructions sculpture.

He was born in the workers' camp at Garzan oil field in Batman, where his father was employed. He was the second youngest child of a seven children family.

His passion for painting has been with him ever since his childhood. He was awarded his first prize in third grade when he was nine years old.  His acquaintanceship with oil colors occurred at the same time, and in addition to this, his interest in literature appeared at this young age. Since that time, the artist has kept on working permanently. When he reached his high school years, he staged his first personal exhibition in the gallery at his school. Shortly after his graduation, he went on to study in the Faculty of Fine Arts at Mimar Sinan University in Istanbul.  After a while he dropped out of this programme, but later went on to complete his graduate studies at the Anadolu University's  Department of Management.

For a period, he went into business, but soon returned to painting. In 1997, Güneştekin established his first studio in Beyoğlu and from there staged numerous personal and cooperative exhibitions. In the wake of his exhibition “Colors After Darkness”, which he opened in 2003 iat Atatürk Cultural Center (AKM), he gradually began to release his name into the world of art. Through a great number of personal exhibitions, Güneştekin’s works of art now take their place in prestigious domestic and foreign collections. Ahmet Güneştekin, whose signature of his great achievements is his distinctive language, has also attained great success in the design field.

== Documentaries ==
The works of art of Ahmet Güneştekin are the subject of a series of documentaries. Newsreel documentary director Coşkun Aral undertook a long-term directing role following Güneştekin’s progress, starting in 2005 with "Following the Traces of the Sun". Produced for Turkish television station TRT 1, this themed art documentary has the distinction of being the one and only made in Turkey.

== Anatolian Exhibitions with the Masters ==
The artist wandered Turkey city by city tracing its myths. He carried with him many names from contemporary Turkish art and staged exhibitions at historical sites. With his open-air exhibitions in numerous cities throughout Anatolia, under the banner "Following the Traces of The Sun with the Masters", he set a difficult-to-beat record in this field. Within this still continuing project, many  proficient names of contemporary art, sculpture, and photography -who previously had only shown their work in large cities- were presented to the outlying regions of the vast and diverse country that is Turkey.

== Children's Art Studios ==
Another characteristic of Ahmet Güneştekin is bringing art and children together. He visits Turkey city by city, town by town, opening studios for one day in each place he visits. The purpose of these day-studios, which are aimed at children between the ages of five and twelve, is to introduce the magical world of painting, colors, brushes, and dreams to these young minds. So far to date, through this project, Güneştekin has met over 5,000 children. The project continues.

=== Antique Modern ===
While it exists as a definite and specific feature in modern art expression, form in post-modern times is observed and experienced as fragmented and imperceptible through a detached yet consecutive visual experience. Modern means: integrity, continuity, order, nature, form and, most importantly, simplicity. Post modern, on the other hand, is about pieces, disarray, detachedness, context, complexity and, most importantly, essence and ethnic culture. While modernism offers a unifying closed-circuit form mechanism, what is dominant in the art expression of the post-modern era is anti-form and a fragmented structure. (We designate the post-modern era as gaining clarity by 1990). The principles in a modern work of art can be listed as goal, distance, sovereignty, depiction of existence, metaphor, depth, interpretation, the designated, main code, narration, paranoia, the origin, metaphysics, and transcendence.  What comes to the fore in the post-modern era, conversely, are characteristics like game, anarchy, process, puzzle, anti-thesis, nonexistence, disintegration, personal language (idiolect), irony, ambiguity, and immanence. From this perspective, Ahmet Güneştekin's art expression bridges both the modern and post-modern approaches; whilst it harbors the modern characteristics and displays some features of the modern, and displays some features of the modern in terms of the space he reflects, it also offers a refuge for antique characteristics in terms of its themes. In actuality, Ahmet Güneştekin, as an artist fascinated by the antique worlds, stands contrary to Modernism. However, the integrity and unity he reflects on the canvass are the principles of the modern work of art and they greet us as the most important principles that the artist gives the utmost importance to in composing his work. On the other hand, Ahmet Güneştekin, who displays a completely post-modern attitude, also crosshatches the archetypes of the antique worlds, and transforms the ruptures of time - anachronisms - by greeting time perception, thereby transforming them into a functional, formal and spatial aesthetic piece asunder from the whole. To put it another way, the time/space integrity Güneştekin attains on the canvass is the sense of existence that is identical between the past and the future. The major event here is the way the artist grasps the whole. To the artist, who carries the post-modern consciousness, the whole is not simply the sum of the parts, it is more and it is something different. The essence the artist carries -which is a post-modern characteristic- is without beginning and without end. The artist, who also reconstructs the ages and the mind's conception progressing on the intuitive and cognitive platform, turns his back on modern times, instead composing his mind's genuine unity with history. To the artist, who creates planar depths on the canvass, location must expand forward and all of the whole he creates must be meaningful little wholes within an autonomous location approach. Because the whole is much more complex than its pieces, the painting expression moves in terms of systems that are dynamic, self organizing, non linear and intricate.  Modern perception always separated the whole into its pieces assuming an analytical attitude.  This attitude is rejected by the artist as an invalid approach.  Ahmet Güneştekin, while equalizing the sensation of the whole and the chaotic equilibrium on the canvass, confronts his spectators with functional, formal, time-locational pieces broken off from the whole. The wholeness attained on the canvass transforms into a sensual xistence of the non-material existence in between the broken and the broken off, the piece and the whole, the past and the future.  We therefore encounter, in an Ahmet Güneştekin canvass, elements pertaining to both the modern and post-modern. Aesthetic expression is the sum of the components that compose a painting.  What the artist asserts are principles. Both history and tradition are causal formations by themselves. If tradition completely disappears, it means that the cause and the meaning of existence also disappear. Traditions are socil structures that are continuously transformed and reconstructed by threats, social fluctuations, external impacts, geographical and ethnological factors, wars, and internal administrative insistences. As you can observe, one of the most important aims we detect in the Ahmet Güneştekin creative process is the volition of the artist to get even with tradition and to reconstruct it.  The disposition of the antique narrations, antique loves, into the present time brackets by the artist, is in fact an expression of his ideal. In between the two extremities the artist oscillates, that is historicism on the one hand and his application of free style on the other. It is observed that he experiences and creates his paintings through being nourished by history, nature and the rich, fertile historical consciousness of the Mesopotamian region. Multiple pasts, multiple desires, multiple longings to reflect, and multiple revolts take place in this painting as internal elements and layers.

=== Transcendental - Formal/Sensation Horizon ===
The Ahmet Güneştekin aesthetic expression talks about a life aspiration whose roots and aim reside in an upper world. The painting expression which progresses based on motives obtained from fairy tales, legends and myths present in the artist's connotation horizon, announces the existence of a world which renders possibility for Güneştekin's connotation unifications with mythological archetypal expansion.  The next phase is putting into use the abstract symbols which are connected to meaningful forms and images - reflecting in a more rational way together with the aesthetic creative process of the transcendental-formal connotation horizon.  The third phase is itemizing the paint and colors as elements accentuating connotation of the metaphysical rendezvous and the mystical topic - the irrational and transcendental connotation horizon - in a striking way.  The major objective of the artist here is to entrap an infinity conception whether in terms of the thematic or in the name of the formal or the transcendental.  From this perspective, if we accept a specific canvass of the artist as the beginning point, we see that the composition depicted on the surface goes far beyond the canvass and reaches out to the subtexts.  Considering the bigger picture, rather than the spiritual and subtext, when we look at a canvass of Ahmet Güneştekin we see the processing of time continuities in the format of seasons.  Imaginary and mental time and increase in time are proposed as transformations into legends - which means the conversion of the millennium archetypal process of thought into paintings.  In short, Ahmet Güneştekin canvasses are like a tablet, each of which impersonates the progress into infinity of the cult time and its immortal reflection energies. While the artist revives, on the one hand, the soul's thousands of years' everlasting monumental concepts, he emphasizes, on the other hand, the necessity of the imaginary reality that humanity has long forgotten.  In this way, the realistic dreams experienced through thousands of years floating in antique darkness, transform into a yearning for infinity on the tip of his brush.  He is involved in prophetic work; prophetic because his mind experiences the most sacred moments of a renewal, a structuring process conjoined with the essence of legends.  The hereditary archetypes of the social subconscious which is devoid of any content and continues eternally - fairy tales, legends, myths - are, according to Jung, the organs of the pre-rational psyche.  It acts as if it is the universal mind.  It resides in a transcendental and metaphysical dimension.  Ahmet transforms, on the canvass, the essential unity of the mind and the universe, all the mental and spiritual activities of humanity in ancient times, into a Phantasmagoria of the creative act.  Because of the single spherical plenary conveyance routines of the holistic reflection, the artist acts as if he is putting forward a secret space-age element.  At the highest scale of this time hierarchy lies Comprehension Time.

=== Comprehension Time ===
In the Magdalenian Age the first prehistoric artist, who drew, painted figures on rocks or dry bones using red gypsum and manganese-iron black; in fact he expressed himself and his environment by way of symbols, signs and scribbling. The prehistoric artist was a Homo Sapiens who created paintings not only in caves, but also on the human body.  Body art, which became a most trendy movement after the 1950s, was in fact within the scope of application, millions of years ago, of the prehistoric artists. It is very clear that the scope of drawing, of prehistoric man, was very wide, with representations, on cave walls, of living forms – animals of the time - standing side by side with symbols of unreal, imaginary beings. In short, the drawing knowledge of Sapiens man was given at birth.  The attainment and spread of the talent for drawing does not mean anything more than self-expression by ideographic and painting signs.  The classical era artist, on the other hand, always progressed with mimetic success.  To the classical artist who wants to understand and know, in essence, nature and its depictions, depicting nature – the external world, the human being – was the chief objective.  Among the classical artists whose external world perception was restricted, very few of them who touched universal formation could comprehend the holistic integrity. And they, as a matter of fact, would take their place in history as geniuses as per their reflective loftiness.  Because, however, the comprehension of time of each was beyond the very moment they lived, we can easily talk here of the existence of a comprehended time or, in other words, the existence of time dimensions perceived through comprehension.  Our consciousness conceives the universe and existence via two methods – direct and indirect.  The direct method is the existence of external world, things and objects, right here in the perception of the mind.  The indirect method, on the other hand, is the method of imagining and presenting to the conscious, things and objects that do not have a concrete existence, through the meditation of symbols.  From this dimension, the multi-coded attitudes seen on the Güneştekin canvass are closely related to the perception and reanimation of his historical consciousness.  All the myths experienced in the Hyper-Localities of the past, and especially the Mesopotamian immortal love myths culminating in death, and their projections pertain to his topics of attraction.  In the planar depth we witness on his canvass – which is made up of several layers – we encounter the life energy of the sacred antique lands, the soul of the tablets written in ancient language, the smell of the soil, love metaphors, and betrayal and death. To the artist all these are related to the soul’s infinitude.  The artist, on the other hand, continuously analyzes the concepts of the infinitude reflection.  None of his canvasses reaches completion; each progresses as the sequel of another and covers distance in scope.  Another of the layers observed in the Güneştekin canvass is the presence of a secret language whose characters are newly being used.  The language opens the way to time and localities the artist comprehends, and carries the symbols of the Mesopotamian region to the present.  The mythical forms which are far ahead of the modern age, builds up his consciousness and comprehension time. The heroic taste, the fairy tale power and courage gaining infinitude on the canvass descending from the myths, and the universalization of the sensations, gathering of the common memory, and infinite imagination, power turning points. The comprehension time perception as an upper code helps call back the ages of the myths and their completion in its entity. An Ahmet Güneştekin canvass surface progresses with processes whereby colliding distinct form mechanisms transform by way of harmonizing complexity, and the processes which constitute the façade of this transformation.

=== Comprehension Space ===
Each of his canvasses has been organized so that the reflection of depth has disappeared and the perspective dimension is extracted from the frontal surface of the painting even further to the front. In an Ahmet Güneştekin canvass, what is in question is not any diminishing towards the back but rather expansion towards the front. Composition which lies in the emptiness in between the art interpreter looking at the painting and the surface of the canvass, bears, therefore, a sculpture-like taste and the idea of supremacy is embroidered to the full. At the beginning of the 20th Century the Cubists, through the understanding of space they applied in painting expression, turned all the laws of the classical and impressionist space upside down, thereby passing to a brand new transcendental domain, carrying a brand new dimension to the canvass.  This was the third dimension.  With this revolution, the linear perspective and the aerial perspective that were in use in art expression until then were totally abandoned. In the 20th century, art expression in which all the pre- and high Renaissance techniques like creating three-dimensional emptiness with drawings, and taking the concept of shadow in the figure and dimensioning it in one horizontal line, were abandoned and instead creating a non-allusive canvass became almost the only target of all artists.

=== Allegoric Tablet ===
Ahmet Güneştekin art symbols and figures proceed at a frequency that impairs established expression in painting.  We get the feeling vis-a-vis these figures that we are looking at an ancient tablet.  There is one difference, however, and it is the subject or the thematic layer the artist processes in these depictions that do not carry a narrative characteristic. The artist, rather than telling a story, builds up his paintings on the quest of mankind in the world.

=== Immortal Icons ===
As we have mentioned before, Ahmet Güneştekin wants, in his art expression, to make the object of painting, peculiar to location, an element of time. This desire requires his interpreting the space he creates on the canvass from different perspectives.  This means, in turn, that the reflection of infinity belongs to the quantity and quality of the canvass.  Or else it means that he must interpret the painting expression by making these characteristics, which are at the perception dimension, belong to the canvass.  To the artist, infinity is not restricted to the canvass in a finite manner. Even though the canvass ends, infinity surpasses the finite and proceeds on its way.
