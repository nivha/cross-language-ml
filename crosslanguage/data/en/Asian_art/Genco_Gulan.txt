==Art==

Genco uses text, codes and even his own DNA in his art. He is a conceptual, contextual new media artist, developing theory as well as practice. He specializes in not knowing what everybody else knows. Genco Gulan believes in the artistic future of bio-technology, artificial intelligence, and digital communication. In a video piece called “Grundig”, he filmed a female swim team playing rugby underwater with a TV monitor.

"If it's not new, it's just media," says Gulan in regards to the importance of novelty. His experimental works include net-art, web art, A.I.gen (generated) images, Robot Games, SCIgen papers and online videos. Genco uses boron in his sculptures.

==Museum==

As an art project in 1997, Genco Gulan established the first “Istanbul Contemporary Art Museum.”

"At first the Istanbul Contemporary Art Museum developed as an art series in the manner of Duchamp and Broodthaers until the end of the 1990s. Later it evolved when it was transferred to the Internet. It turned into a new age institution that organized exhibitions, workshops and provided logistic support on cyber space."

For almost a decade, the museum ran an unorthodox residency program called "I live in a Museum" and hosted artists from the U.S., Holland, Spain, and China at its the Galata location.
After the Istanbul location closed, Genco Gulan, in Berlin, manifested himself as a Museum.

Gulan's monograph; "Conceptual Colors" edited by Dr. Marcus Graf, is co-published by Revolver Publishing in Berlin in collaboration with Artist Istanbul. His books are available at libraries such as the German National Library, SALT Istanbul, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Thomas J. Watson Library and the Haas Family Arts Library at Yale University. Gulan founded the Web Biennial 
at the turn of the century, served on the Board of Balkan Biennial in Thessaloniki, International Programming Committee of ISEA Singapore in 2008 and was a guest editor for Second Nature: International Journal of Creative Media. He was in the jury for Turgut Pura Art Prize in Izmir and teaches at Mimar Sinan Academy and Bogazici University.
