Pera Museum is a private museum in the Tepebaşı quarter of the Beyoğlu district in Istanbul, Turkey. It was founded by the Suna and İnan Kıraç Foundation with the aim of offering a broad range of high-quality culture and arts services. Inaugurated on 8 June 2005, the museum is located in the historic building of the former Hotel Bristol, which was designed by architect Achille Manoussos and built in 1893. It was renovated between 2003 and 2005 by restorer architect Sinan Genim, who preserved the facade of the building and transformed the interior into a modern and fully equipped museum.

==The permanent collection==
Pera Museum shares its three permanent collections Orientalist Paintings, Anatolian Weights and Measures, and Kütahya Tiles and Ceramics, as well as the values that these collections represent, with the public through exhibitions, publications, audio-visual events, educational activities, and academic works, striving to transmit these values to future generations.

===Orientalist Painting Collection===
The Suna and İnan Kıraç Foundation's Orientalist Painting Collection brings together important works by European artists inspired by the Ottoman world, Turkey’s regional geography, as well as works of Ottoman artists and how they influenced one another from the 17th century to the early 19th. The Collection presents a vast visual panorama of the last two centuries of the Ottoman Empire, also includes works by Osman Hamdi Bey and his most famous painting, the Tortoise Trainer.

===Anatolian Weights and Measures Collection===
The Anatolian Weights and Measures Collection comprises over ten thousand pieces and consists of objects dating from prehistory to those used in present day Anatolia. These comprise the main types of scales and measuring instruments, used for measuring weight, length, and volume in every field, from land measurement to commerce, architecture to jewelery making, shipping to pharmacy.

===Kütahya Tiles and Ceramics Collection===
The beginnings of the Suna and İnan Kıraç Foundation's Kütahya Tiles and Ceramics Collection date back to the 1980s. Today the collection consists of over 800 pieces representing various periods, especially the 18th - 20th centuries. The limited number of pieces on display have been chosen to give a general idea of the collection and the craftsmanship of Kütahya ceramics.
