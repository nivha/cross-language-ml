==Early life==
He was born on May 21, 1968 in Istanbul, Turkey. He is in fifth generation descendant of Admiral Ali Pasha, commander of the Ottoman navy during Sultan Mahmud II. Ali Pasha was burned to death in his admiral ship during an attack after successfully controlling the uprising of the ethnic islanders against Ottoman Empire on the Aegean island Chios on March 23, 1822. Thus Nasuh’s family name Mahruki, which means, "burnt" in Ottoman Turkish.

After finishing high school at Şişli Terakki High School in Istanbul in 1987, Mahruki attended the School of Business Administration at Bilkent University in Ankara, and graduated in 1992. During his time at the university, he was introduced to mountain climbing in the university climbing club and later became club president. At the age of 20, he developed a passion for various outdoor sports. He made the first paragliding flight over Mount Erciyes, climbed up the Great Demirkazık mountain's north wall, and dove into the underground waters of the Altınbeşik and Kırkgözler Caves.

==Mountaineering career==
Between 1992 and 1994, Mahruki climbed the five highest former Soviet mountains in Asia (Khan Tengri, Lenin Peak, Peak Korzhenevskaya, Communism Peak and Peak Pobeda), which are all over 7,000 metres high. This achievement gained him the honorific title "Snow Leopard", awarded by the Russian Climbing Federation. This recognition led him to his high altitude mountaineering career.

Mahruki summited Mount Everest (8,848 m.) on May 15, 1995, being the first ever Turkish and Muslim person to do so. In 1996, he completed the climbing of Seven Summits in seven continents (Everest, Aconcagua, Vinson Massif, Kilimanjaro, McKinley, Elbrus and Kosciuszko), being the youngest person to do so.
 
In 1997, he climbed Cho Oyu (8,201 m) solo, setting a Turkish record. He next ascended Lhotse (8,516 m) without an oxygen tank in 1998 and climbed the very dangerous and difficult K2 (8,611 m).

Nasuh travels a lot collecting data for his books and documentaries. He is the president of AKUT, a voluntary search-and-rescue organization based in Istanbul he co-founded in 1996. AKUT rushes to outdoor accidents and major natural disasters all over the world, like the 1999 earthquake in Turkey, Nantou - Tayvan earthquake, Gujarat - India earthquake, Bam - Iran earthquake, Mozambique flood, the 2005 Kashmir earthquake.
