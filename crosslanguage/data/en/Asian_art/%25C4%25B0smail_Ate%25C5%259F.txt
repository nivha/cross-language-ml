İsmail Ateş (pronounced /ˌɪsˈmɑːɪl  ˌɑtɛʃ/, born Göle, Ardahan Province, Turkey; 1960) is a Turkish artist and professor.

He graduated from Faculty of Education in Art, Painting Department of Gazi University in 1982. In 1988, he received his "Master of Fine Arts" degree at Hacettepe University, then, in 1993, received his "Doctor of Philosophy" degree under the title of "The Relation Between Form, Texture and Geometric Surfaces as an Element in Painting" at the same institution.

İsmail Ateş, who has had many exhibitions in Turkey and abroad, did research on "American Art" and "Art Training" in the Department of Art at the City University of New York, Hunter College between 2002–2004 and he is currently teaching at Hacettepe University's Faculty of Fine Arts.

In paintings of İsmail Ateş, the geometries which explain space, get an organic quality with soft movements of colors. Continual color and ton transformations now present time and space continuity, as Bergson says, the existence of entity with its whole past, the endless variations and transformations of colors, to entirety and continuity of perception. In all sensation parameters, color, is the most connected with sensations and spirituel situations, the most boundless and independent sensorial form. In paintings of İsmail Ateş, color, with a geometric genre, gets a top-level mental quality. In a sense, this paintings evoke, transformation of the paintings of Kandinsky into mental symbols more than being sensational.

Some of his paintings are in various museums and private collections which can be indicated as Ankara Art Museum, Ministry of Culture Art Collection, PTT Museum Collection, General Directorate of Youth and Sports Collection, General Directorate of TPAO Collection, Central Bank Collection, Hacettepe University Collection, Istanbul Ciragan Palace Collection, Hacettepe Art Museum, METU Art Collection, Ankara University Art Collection, Şefik Bursalı Museum, New York United Nations Plaza and other private and local collections around Turkey and the world primarily in Amsterdam, Maastricht and New York.
