Pascal Sébah (1823–1886) was a pioneer photographer who worked in Istanbul. He was born in Istanbul to a Syrian Catholic father and an Armenian mother. In 1857 he opened his first photography studio in Istanbul and by 1873 was successful enough to open another studio in Cairo. After he died in 1886, the studio was managed by his brother Cosmi until Pascal's son, Jean, joined him in 1888.
Pascal Sebah died on 15 June 1886, and, since he was a Catholic, was buried in the Latin cemetery in Ferikoy. His son, Jean, is also buried there. Jean died on 6 June 1947, at the age of 75.
