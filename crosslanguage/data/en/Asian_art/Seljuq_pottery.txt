Seljuq pottery was the pottery of the Seljuq Empire. With the end of the Seljuq Empire in the 14th century, the Ottoman Empire took over some of the traditions of the Seljuqs, especially in the early stages of Ä°znik pottery.

Tiles are known from the Seljuq period, which use the Minai technique. The technique involved the usqge of seven colors, with blue, green and turquoise applied on an underglaze and fired. Other colors such as yellow, red, white, black and sometimes gilt were then applied on top of this, and re-fired at a lower temperature.
