First Turkish painters appeared no earlier than the mid 19th century during the Ottoman Empire era. (However, there were a few miniaturists before the 19th century.)  But, in the 19th century the art training was offered to male painters only. But a few women painters also appeared who learned painting by private lessons. The first Turkish woman painter was Müfide Kadri. The first art academy for girls was Sanayi'i Nefise which became co-educational in 1914.  
During the Turkish Republic era,  art training was promoted by the government and beginning by 1930 painting courses were added to the curriculum of the schools.
