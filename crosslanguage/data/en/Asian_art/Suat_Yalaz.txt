Suat Yalaz (born 1 January 1932) is a Turkish comic book artist. He is foremost known as the creator of the character Karaoğlan.

==Early career==
Graduated from Istanbul Academy of Fine Arts, Yalaz began working as a cartoonist in Turkish press and his chef d'œuvre Karaoğlan began to be published in the daily Akşam in 1962, later to be published as a comics magazine by 1963.

==French works==
In 1970, Yalaz settled in France where he created two French language Arab adaptations/spinoffs of Karaoğlan; Changor (1971) for Éditions de Lutèce and Kébir (or Kébir l'invincible; first series 1971 - 1975, second series 1975 - 1977) for Société Française de Presse Illustrée, which were destined for Maghreb readers and had considerable reception particularly in Algeria. He also created the Western comics series Ringo (1971 - 1972) and Sony (1972 - 1974) for Société Française de Presse Illustrée.

===Gi-Toro===
Between 1979 and 1981 Yalaz used the pseudonym Gi-Toro for two magazines (Détective Strictement Privé and Super Flic) featuring the popular private investigator character Pat Magnum. A prolific comic book creator, he has also written and drawn a large number of adult comics particularly in the 1980s under the same pseudonym (sometimes as Jimmy Toro) for several French magazines, which include African Love, Anna, Emma, Eros BD, Futurella, Kora, Lady Sex, Lovisex, Sadissimo, Satanika, Satarella, Sex Negros, and Sylvia.
