==Architectural philosophy==

Gokhan Avcıoglu thinks that architecture is relevant with urbanism in Turkey, but today the city forms are not the selection of the architects also opened to development which is parcel parcel of the field cause to society away from each other in our country.Also he believes that some groups allows the reconstruction gain with this arrangement. Avcıoglu thinks, town planning scheme must be like the old villages such as different rhythms but now, there is uniformity in the city plan. That's why the real estate market is having trouble producing different things and are scheduled according to this arrangement brings the most money.

Generally, architects offered that they are moving without questioning the programs which is demand. Architects agree that work under restrictive conditions such as economical and design problems. To date, architects should use to design for communicate personal wishes of our customers, globally, urban, ecological, new perspectives, new pleasure and enthusiasm, they do not for design a prestige or not as a means of persuasion that brings new approaches need to add.
Gokhan Avcıoglu thinks that more days of light using which hampers their energy structures have the right to basic sited economies; to assurecological environment as a starting point for design.
