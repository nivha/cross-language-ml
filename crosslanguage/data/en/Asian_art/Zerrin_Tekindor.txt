Being an actress also shapes Zerrin Tekindor’s paintings. The heroes of many plays are settled on her canvas as Tekindor’s figures by using mixed technique. With their costumes, actions, lines, and even with their appearances under the stage light, they become paintings, being filtered through Tekindor’s interpretation who is also part of that particular action on the stage.
