Setenay Özbek (born 1961, in Istanbul, Turkey) Is a Turkish writer, artist and documentary maker.

==Biography==
In 1990, she graduated from Marmara University, Faculty of Fine Arts (Department of Performing Arts), and has also embarked on a writing career.

From 1983 to 1986, Özbek studied art informally at the "Istasyon Fine Art Academy", under the tutelage of several artists, Sabri Berkel, Hülya Düzenli, Erkan Özdilek and Ergül Özkutan. Her abstract expressionist paintings make frequent use of acrylic and oil techniques, they have a bold appearance due to the contrasting colours and shapes employed. Since 1986, Özbek went on to branch out into documentary film making.

In 2009, she got the Bakrac Art Gallery 30th Year Painting Competition, 1. Prize.

In 2009, Fifth Tashkent Biennale of Contemporary Art, "The 3rd Runner up".

She is a member of International PEN Association of Writers and International Association of Art (A.I.A.A) to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). 
 
Özbek's paintings hang in several private collections and she continues to produce paintings in her own workshop.

Setenay Özbek participated in the Beyond Borders Dialogue and Cultural Exchange held in Traquair House in Scotland. She delivered a speech on the freedom of expression and artists'responsibility in resisting state pressure on art and artistic expression in the Assembly Rooms One in Edinburgh on 23 August 2011 and took part in the question and answer session that followed her speech.
