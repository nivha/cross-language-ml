Mari Gerekmezyan (1913–1945) is considered the first female sculptor of Turkey and the lover of the famous Turkish poet and painter Bedri Rahmi Eyüboğlu.

==Life==
Of Armenian descent, Mari Gerekmezyan was born in the Talas village near Kayseri. She attended the local Vart Basrig Primary Armenian School. She moved to Constantinople where she attended the Yesayan Armenian School. While studying at Yesayan, Gerekmezyan had the opportunity to meet famed Turkish author Ahmet Hamdi Tanpınar. Tanpınar inspired Gerekmezyan to pursue a degree in philosophy. She would go on the study at the University of Istanbul. She would become a guest student at the sculpture division of the Güzel Sanatlar Akademisi (Great Arts Academy). At the Academy, she was taught by famed German sculptor Rudolf Belling.

Gerekmezyan was also an Art and Armenian language teacher at the Getronagan and Yesayan Armenian High Schools.

At the age of 32, Gerekmezyan died from tuberculosis; she is buried in the Sisli Armenian Cemetery.

Much of Gerekmezyan's works are missing. Her remaining works are found in the Resim ve Heykel Müzesi (Museum of Painting and Sculpture) in İstanbul and in the Private Collection of the Eyüboğlu Family which includes her famous bust of Bedri Rahmi.

==Relationship with Bedri Rahmi Eyüboğlu==
While Gerekmezyan was a guest student at the sculpture division of the Güzel Sanatlar Akademisi (Great Arts Academy), she met Bedri Rahmi Eyüboğlu. Throughout the 1940s, Gerekmezyan assisted Bedri Rahmi Eyüboğlu in his artwork. The two would eventually fall in love. Their relationship is compared to the likes of Auguste Rodin and Camille Claudel. Gerekmezyan had sculpted many busts of Eyüboğlu and Eyüboğlu likewise drew many sketches of Gerekmezyan. Eyüboğlu wrote his famous poem Karadut (Mulberry) for Mari Gerekmezyan after her death:

When he first read the poem in public, Eyüboğlu cried. It is believed that Eyüboğlu continued to love Gerekmezyan the rest of his life. The poem would become popular as it was incorporated into Cem Karaca's song Karadut.

==Legacy==
The Getronagan Armenian High School in Istanbul hosted an exhibition for Mari Gerekmezyan in December 2012, organized by famed Armenian photographer Ara Guler.
