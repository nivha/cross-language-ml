Andean textiles represent a continuing textile tradition spanning at least ten thousand years. Fiberwork has been found in Guitarrero Cave, Peru dates back to 8000 BCE. Beginning with non-loom, twined cotton fabric, this textile tradition expanded to include alpaca and llama wool. Today Andean weavers are known worldwide for their skills and rich traditions.

==Origins==
The Norte Chico civilization were the earliest known users of textiles in the Andes. They wove them of cotton. They were also the first to use the Quipu. The Quipu is a series of knotted strings that were used for accounting, using base 10, and also possibly as a binary logographic system of writing.

==Quilted armour==

Quilted armour of the Andeans was much lighter, more comfortable, and almost as protective as European steel plate armour.

==Loom==

The Andeans used the back strap loom.

The Andeans had very advanced technology in textile technology, about as advanced as Eurasians were in metal technology.
