Lewis Brian Adams was an English painter who spent most of his career in Venezuela.  He studied at the Royal Academy of Art, and exhibited there for a number of years.  Just why he came to Caracas is unknown, but it seems likely that he came to paint in a market where he could find less competition.  He introduced a number of trends from English portraiture to the world of Venezuelan art.

Adams became acquainted with the Prussian painter Ferdinand Bellermann during the latter's time in Venezuela.
