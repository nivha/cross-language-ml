Beginning in 1872, Tovar y Tovar featured prominently in numerous expositions and galleries in Venezuela, including the very first Exposición Anual de Bellas Artes held in Venezuela. Indeed, the Venezuelan president Antonio Guzmán Blanco himself tasked him with painting the many portraits of prominent Venezuelans that would be needed in a new gallery that would grace the Venezuelan capitol building. His works now feature on a large domed ceiling, as well as the Capitol's walls.
