José Gamarra, born in Montevideo in 1934, is a painter who has lived in Paris since 1964.

His paintings are usually landscapes, with a dreamlike tropical universe. Grand forests, lianas, troubled waters, and living anacondas and caimans are often placed in historical or incongruous scened.

His favourite theme is the denunciation of colonialism, with caravelles and helicopters present in an otherwise harmonious scene emphasising their indesirable presence.
