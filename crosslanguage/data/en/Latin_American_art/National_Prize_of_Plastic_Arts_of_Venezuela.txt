National Prize of Plastic Arts of Venezuela is an annual award given to various artists from that country, specifically the field of drawing, printmaking and drawing pictorial. He is one of National Culture Awards.

His reward is delivered continuously since 1947. In 1952 delivery stopped for about 19 years, resumed in 1971. The grant award is made on an annual basis since its first edition until 2001, when he took a biennial. An exception to this rule was 2003, when it waited three years to give the next award, and then return to biennial delivery.
