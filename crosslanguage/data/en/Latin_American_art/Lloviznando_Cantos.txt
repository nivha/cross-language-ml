The Frente Revolucionario de Cantores (Revolutionary Singers Front) Lloviznando Cantos is a Venezuela based artists collective founded in 2001. The collective is a contemporary heir to the historical traditions of the Nueva Canción movement of the 1960s and 1970s. Their stated reason for being is to consolidate and bring to the masses political and social message of solidarity as conceived in the "socialist revolution" being carried out by Venezuelan president Hugo Rafael Chávez Frías. Their greater aim is to spread this message to the rest of Latin America.

The collective has played in places such as Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Bolivia, Ecuador, Panama, Nicaragua, Guatemala, El Salvador, as well as in Europe. They have been usually sponsored by social and community grassroots organizations and organizations in solidarity with the current Venezuelan government.

As heirs of the Nueva Canción movement, they are performing what they call the Canción Socialista (Socialist Song).
