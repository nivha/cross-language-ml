Wladimiro Politano was born in February 19, 1940 in Lago (Cosenza), Italy. Graduated in the "Accademia di Belle Arti di Roma" and here he started his artistic development as a drawer, painter and sculptor. He lived in Rome until 1966, when he moved to Caracas, Venezuela. Seven years later he went to New York where he lived for ten years. During this period of time Politano participated in different public and private exhibitions in the United States, Austria, Japan, Venezuela and Italy. He produced plenty and a wide variety of art works exhibited in several national and international galleries and museums. The Künstlerhause Museum of Vienna invited him in 1978, as the only foreign artist, to celebrate the One Hundred Years of the Künstlerhause Museum, together with the outstanding Austrian artists from the School of Fantastic Realism. There he  realized an individual exhibition. Because of his grand merits, in July 1980, the city of New Rochelle N.Y. awarded him the title “Commendatio ”. In 1981 Politano and others great masters inaugurated “The Museum of Modern Art Toyama” in Shingogaura, Toyama-Shi, in Japan, where two of his paintings are present in permanent exhibition. In Florida he received the “Sylvia Daro Dawidowicz International Award” directly by the president herself. In 1983, he returns to Caracas to work with both private and public projects. Participate in Caracas to "Escultura Symposium 1985" and his model remained as a symbol of the "VIII Biennale of Architecture" in the "Museo de Bellas Artes" and then will be constructed in large dimension. This sculpture is called "Puntas de Plata" and is in permanent exhibition at the Caracas’s Metro, Station "El Silencio”. Politano in this period lived and worked between Venezuela, Italy and Sweden. In 2003, he was invited as a curator and artist to participate in the "II Biennial of Painting" in Konstgall Väsby, Stockholm, Sweden. Here master Politano took part  in various collective exhibitions and dealings with different cultures. The colors of nature so different from the tropical enrich the color molded in his paintings. Creating and animating works, constantly renewing itself without fatigue, such as an apostle of Art. He was invited to the first International Sculpture Symposium 2007 SIEIM made in 'Margarita Island, Nueva Esparta Venezuela. For an outstanding art creativity and important artistic production outside his native country, he received the most important awards from the President of Italy, ”The Italy in the World Award”. This shows the quality of majestic artistry whose creation is based on passion, originality, expertise in drawing and a tireless work. Today, Politano lives between Caracas, Rome, Lago-Calabria and Stockholm, places where he has his Studios and will soon will open a new one at Miami.

==Critics==
“Wladimiro Politano is essentially Latin due to his Italian origin, and Latin American because of his life and work in Venezuela and the realismo mágico (magical realism) present in his painting –a type of expression considered as pragmatic and definitive of Latin American fabulist imagination. One cannot disregard what lingers of New York in the artist, since he lived for ten years in this city, where his work was exhibited many times. Therefore, Politano’s art is literally a globalized art, although it is envisioned from Venezuela.
In the present phase of his production, distant already from Geometric Abstractionism (except in some of his steel sculptures), Politano has matured a new artistic language, proper, very personal, enriched by a coherent formal vocabulary and a thematic repertoire that centers on the human figure. It is a non-realistic figure, not intended to describe its visual appearance or to serve in analytic speculation, but to allude, lyrically. To a general human condition in the midst of unreal and metaphoric scenes.
These paintings move about in an atmosphere of deferred effusiveness, of watchfulness, of doubt, of silence, of coldness. Yet, inside, there is a burning fire perceived in the images, affording them a secret and intense underlying life.”

”Today is a great day for the artist that we have the honour to introduce to you; a great day for Politano, since it becomes visible that a new era of rewards to his efforts begins, his desire to project himself in an international way taking with him, as Italian-Venezuelan, the Italian and Venezuelan flags interweaved, with his message of humanity, faith and peace to the whole world.
With great modesty, one of his characteristics, that is well known by all those living near him, he wants to pay his respects and gratefulness to Venezuela, very much loved foster country, where   under its purest tropical lights he received his creative inspiration with which he later created his work of art; also to all his friends and art collectors, that had and unbreakable faith in him and his art from the beginning of his carrier. This new stage in Politano´s art offer an extraordinary sensitive strength, a complete security in the composition of volume, the plastic balance and a personal style that expresses the honesty of the emotions and the absolute control of the craft.  Is our sincere conviction that this sample of Politano´s art will get through to the hearts of those that contemplate it and for those searching something more than plane sympathetic co-efficiency in a picture, this exhibition will fill with complete satisfaction the lovers of today’s modern Art.  “
