Daniel Pontet (born 1957) is a Uruguayan-born artist working in the US.
== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
Pontet was born in Montevideo, Uruguay, South America, in and has resided in Miami, Florida since 1991. He developed artistically in Uruguay, under watercolor painter and art teacher Esteban Garino – who taught him the art of drawing and composition - and under artists Americo Sposito and Hector Laborde, who instilled into him the magic of color and a particular emphasis on space and shapes. He also completed courses in Art History at the School of Humanities of the University of the Republic of Uruguay. Furthermore, he studied silkscreen, photography, and computer graphics as a complement to his art education. 
=== Career ===
The earliest stage of Pontet’s work can be placed within the expressionist and the neo expressionist circles and during this time he uses drawing as a fundamental element. He opens and closes spaces and organizes his balance and refuge in the canvass with grace and strength, as well as drama and lyricism. In this period, he devotes most of his energy and power of expression to depicting a world of indifferent, dauntless, and forlorn characters. Pontet stirs these meditative beings with an expressionist glare, manifesting a deep and underlying reflection on the human condition. He also creates unique rhythmical and chromatic consonances throughout these motifs. Pontet’s early series share outstanding traits characterized by accomplished drawing, well thought-out compositions, mathematically precise structures, distortions and deliberate elongations, as well as the use of a rich polychrome palette of tones and hues.

Today, immersed in a new plastic period called “Metamorphosis,” Pontet is re-creating part of an enigmatic world of symbols. From realism to abstraction, Pontet’s current work – teeming with feelings, thoughts, meditations, and not lacking in lyricism - is eminently plastic. His compositions, far from being descriptive, narrative or literary, are true plastic records of thoughts expressed in two- or three-dimensional surfaces. These works of art or “collages” look like accurate maps where we can find a path to think as well as reflect about our own spiritual life. This late series is also characterized by colors extracted from the soil – from brown to red oxide – and incrusted objects – keys, nails, washers, piece of fabrics, threads - which become powerful symbols and metaphors. Each symbol carries a profound spiritual message.

Daniel Pontet started exhibiting in 1975 and has participated in more than 80 art shows. He has received several prizes and acknowledgments and continues to show that his creativity has found no end. Effort and devotion are his most precious tools along with truthfulness.

As the Chilean writer Antonio Landauro once said about Daniel Pontet: “It goes without saying that this creative artist, like all genuine artists, always attains self-expression, whether he is understood, half understood, or not at all.”
