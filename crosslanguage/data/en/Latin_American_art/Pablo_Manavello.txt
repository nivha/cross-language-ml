Pablo Manavello (born Paolo Manavello; May 21, 1950) is an Italian-Venezuelan composer, guitarist, singer and songwriter.

Manavello began his career in the mid-60s with Los Memphis, a pop-rock band from Caracas influenced by The Beatles. Los Memphis released their first album in 1967 and another one in 1969 before disbanding. Later he founded Sangre, which released a self-titled album 1971. He worked as a session musician before collaborating with Juan Michelena in the protest album "Dicen que soy..." in 1977 and joining Vytas Brenner's Venezuelan fusion band Ofrenda.

In 1979 he released Cosas Sencillas, his first solo album and began a successful career as composer and producer of many Latin artists and bands. He interrupted his career after receiving an scholarship from the Venezuelan Government to study film scoring in Berklee College of Music. He graduated in 1982 and by the late 80s he was one Latinamerica's top music producers.

His debut as composer and producer was Ricardo Montaner's first album in 1986. That album was certified multi-platinum in Venezuela and reached #1 on the Billboard Latin Pop Albums chart. Afterwards, he worked as producer and composer for other Venezuelan acts like Melissa, Kiara, Ilan Chester, Sandino Primera, and others.
