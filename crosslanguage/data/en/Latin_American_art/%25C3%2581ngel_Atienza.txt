Ángel Atienza Landeta (born 16 March 1931 in Madrid) is a Spanish artist and retired footballer who played as a defender for Real Madrid, with whom he won the inaugural European Cup.

==Football career==
Atienza was born in the Spanish capital of Madrid and retired from professional football on 1 July 1960.

Already interested in art, he worked as an artist in the period between playing for Zaragoza and Madrid.

== Art career ==
During his football career, Atienza participated in group exhibitions and maintained ties with the artistic world in his spare time. In 1958, during a journey in Central Europe, he discovered coloured glass fitted in concrete as an artistic expression. Subsequently, he started to collaborate with other artists, retired from football, and began making mosaic murals and stained glass pieces. In 1964, he started to create ceramic murals. His first work was at the Carlton Rioja Hotel in Logroño. He moved to Venezuela in 1976 and began incorporating new materials in his mural work, such as iron, bronze, and aluminium. He participated directly in various architectural projects in order to obtain harmony between his works and their surroundings. In 2001, he returned to Spain, where he continues to work on paintings and participates in exhibitions and showrooms.
