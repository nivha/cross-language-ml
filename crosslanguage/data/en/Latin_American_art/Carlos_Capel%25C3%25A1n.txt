Carlos Capelán (born 1948) is a contemporary artist from Montevideo, Uruguay. Although his conceptual work includes drawings and paintings, his installations are more widely known for their atmospherical impact, constituting an environment in which the viewer is free to wander around and experience notions of displacement. In 1995, Capelán received the Guggenheim Fellowship.

In 1973, Capelán moved to Lund, Sweden. Capelán studied at Grafikskolan Forum in Malmö, Sweden. Capelán currently resides in Moravia, Costa Rica.
