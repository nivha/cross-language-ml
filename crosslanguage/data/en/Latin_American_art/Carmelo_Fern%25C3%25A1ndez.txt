Carmelo Fernández (born San José de Guama, Yaracuy, 1809 - died Caracas, 1887) was a Venezuelan painter and illustrator.  When Simon Bolivar's remains were returned to Venezuela, he made sketches of the event; he also illustrated an atlas by Agostino Codazzi, and provided portraits for the Resumen de la historia de Venezuela, published in 1841.
