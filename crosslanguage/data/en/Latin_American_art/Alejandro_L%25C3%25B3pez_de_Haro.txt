Alejandro López de Haro Ramirez (January 8, 1949 – May 24, 2010) was a Venezuelan photographer, writer and stockbroker. He held a Bachelor of Science in business from Bryant College and an MBA in Finance from New York University.

After founding and managing Bancalf, an investment bank and brokerage house, in Caracas, Venezuela for twenty years López de Haro eventually sold his company and retired to Paris, France and Madrid, Spain. Here he dedicated most of his time to photography and writing. His writings have been published in Analitica Venezuela and the topics usually had to do with the arts and politics. In 1997, he was admitted into the British Institute of Professional Photography until he decided to dedicate himself to art photography rather than more commercial photography. López de Haro worked mostly with platinum prints. In November 2005 his first book of photographs and poems Los Crepúsculos de la Imaginación was published by Lodima Press. Notable buyers of the book have included the Maison Européenne de la Photographie and Karl Lagerfeld's art bookshop Librairie 7L in Paris.
