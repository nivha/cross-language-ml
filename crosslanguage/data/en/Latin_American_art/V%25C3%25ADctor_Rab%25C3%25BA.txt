Víctor Rabú (born 1834 in Agen, Lot-et-Garonne - died 24 March 1907 in Paris) was a French architect.

He was an exponent of eclectical historicism. He built a lot of churches in Uruguay, for that reason he was known as "The Lord of the Churches":
* Iglesia de los Conventuales (1867)
* Capilla Jackson (1870)
* Iglesia San Francisco (1870)
* Iglesia de los Vascos (1870)
Some important public buildings were of his authorship, such as the side wings of the Solís Theatre, or the Dámaso Larrañaga Asylum. He also built several private buildings for wealthy families.
