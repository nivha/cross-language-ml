Antonio Herrera Toro was a Venezuelan painter.  He worked with Martin Tovar y Tovar on some of his decorations of the Federal Palace, but was also an artist in his own right, known especially for his portraits.  Between 1880 and 1882 he decorated the chancel of the Caracas Cathedral; in 1892 he painted the ceiling of the Municipal Theatre in Valencia.
