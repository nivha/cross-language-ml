XTE J1650-500 is a stellar-mass black hole candidate and 2000–2001 transient binary X-ray source located in the constellation Ara.  
In 2008, it was claimed that this black hole had a mass of 3.8±0.5 solar masses, which would have been the smallest found for any black hole. However, this claim was subsequently retracted; the more likely mass is 5–10 solar masses.

The binary period of the black hole and its companion is 0.32 days.
