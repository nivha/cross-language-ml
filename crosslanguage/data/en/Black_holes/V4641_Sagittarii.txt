{"text": "V4641 Sagittarii (V4641 Sgr) is a variable X-ray binary star system in the constellation Sagittarius. It is the source of one of the fastest superluminal jets in our galaxy.\n\nIn 1999 a violent X-ray outburst revealed it to contain a black hole. At the time, it was considered to be the closest known black hole to Earth, at a distance of approximately . Later observations showed it to be at least 15 times farther away.\n\n==References==\n\n==External links==\n* AAVSO Variable Star of the Season, Summer 2006: V4641 Sgr\n* V4641 Sgr \u2013 A Black Hole", "spanish_url": "", "original_url": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V4641_Sagittarii"}
