This is a list of quasars.

Proper naming of quasars are by Catalogue Entry, Qxxxx±yy using B1950 coordinates, or QSO Jxxxx±yyyy using J2000 coordinates. They may also use the prefix QSR. There are currently no quasars that are visible to the naked eye.

==List of named quasars==
This is a list of quasars, with a common name, instead of a designation from a survey, catalogue or list.

==List of multiply imaged quasars==
This is a list of quasars that as a result of gravitational lensing appear as multiple images on Earth.

==List of visual quasar associations==
This is a list of double quasars, triple quasars, and the like, where quasars are close together in line-of-sight, but not physically related.

==List of physical quasar groups==
This is a list of binary quasars, trinary quasars, and the like, where quasars are physically close to each other.

===Large Quasar Groups===

Large quasar groups (LQGs) are bound to a filament of mass, and not directly bound to each other.

==List of quasars with apparent superluminal jet motion==
This is a list of quasars with jets that appear to be superluminal due to relativistic effects and line-of-sight orientation. Such quasars are sometimes referred to as superluminal quasars.

It should be noted that quasars that have a recessional velocity greater than the speed of light (c) are very common. Any quasar with z>1 is going away from us in excess of c. Early attempts to explain superlumic quasars resulted in convoluted explanations with a limit of z=2.326, or in the extreme z z=1 means a redshift indicating travel away from us at the speed of light. The majority of quasars lie between z=2 and z=5 .

==Most distant quasars==

The first time that quasars became the most distant object in the universe was in 1964. Quasars would remain the most distant objects in the universe until 1997, when a pair of non-quasar galaxies would take the title.
