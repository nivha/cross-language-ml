{"text": "This is a list of quasars.\n\nProper naming of quasars are by Catalogue Entry, Qxxxx\u00b1yy using B1950 coordinates, or QSO Jxxxx\u00b1yyyy using J2000 coordinates. They may also use the prefix QSR. There are currently no quasars that are visible to the naked eye.\n\n==List of named quasars==\nThis is a list of quasars, with a common name, instead of a designation from a survey, catalogue or list.\n\n==List of multiply imaged quasars==\nThis is a list of quasars that as a result of gravitational lensing appear as multiple images on Earth.\n\n==List of visual quasar associations==\nThis is a list of double quasars, triple quasars, and the like, where quasars are close together in line-of-sight, but not physically related.\n\n==List of physical quasar groups==\nThis is a list of binary quasars, trinary quasars, and the like, where quasars are physically close to each other.\n\n===Large Quasar Groups===\n\nLarge quasar groups (LQGs) are bound to a filament of mass, and not directly bound to each other.\n\n==List of quasars with apparent superluminal jet motion==\nThis is a list of quasars with jets that appear to be superluminal due to relativistic effects and line-of-sight orientation. Such quasars are sometimes referred to as superluminal quasars.\n\nIt should be noted that quasars that have a recessional velocity greater than the speed of light (c) are very common. Any quasar with z>1 is going away from us in excess of c. Early attempts to explain superlumic quasars resulted in convoluted explanations with a limit of z=2.326, or in the extreme z z=1 means a redshift indicating travel away from us at the speed of light. The majority of quasars lie between z=2 and z=5 .\n\n==Firsts==\n\n==Extremes==\n\n==First quasars found==\n\n==Most distant quasars==\n\nThe first time that quasars became the most distant object in the universe was in 1964. Quasars would remain the most distant objects in the universe until 1997, when a pair of non-quasar galaxies would take the title.
