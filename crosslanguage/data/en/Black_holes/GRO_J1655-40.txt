This can be easily modeled assuming propagation of an oscillating shock wave: steadily going closer to the black hole due to rise\nin the Keplerian component rate in the rising phase and going away from the black hole as viscosity is withdrawn in the declining phase. The shock appears to be propagating at a speed\nof a few meters per second.\n\n==References==\n\n==External links==\n*http://blackholes.stardate.org/directory/factsheet.php?id=11\n*Simbad\n*", "spanish_url": "", "original_url": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRO_J1655-40"}
