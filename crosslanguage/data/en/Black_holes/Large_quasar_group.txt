A large quasar group (LQG) is a collection of quasars (a form of supermassive black hole active galactic nuclei) that form what are believed to constitute the largest astronomical structures in the known universe.  LQGs are thought to be precursors to the sheets, walls and filaments of galaxies found in the relatively nearby universe.

==Prominent LQGs==
On January 11, 2013, the discovery of the Huge-LQG was announced by the University of Central Lancashire, as the largest known structure in the universe by that time. It comprises seventy-three quasars, with a minimum diameter of 1.4 billion light-years, but over four billion light-years at its widest point. According to researcher and author, Roger Clowes, the existence of structures of the magnitude of large quasar clusters was believed theoretically impossible.  Cosmological structures had been believed to have a size limit of approximately 1.2 billion light-years.
