In theoretical physics, in particular in numerical relativity, a dynamical horizon (DH) is a mathematical formalism that was originally developed by Abhay Ashtekar and others (see ).  It provides a description of a black hole that is evolving (e.g. one that has a non-zero mass-energy influx).  A related formalism, for black holes with zero influx, is an isolated horizon.
