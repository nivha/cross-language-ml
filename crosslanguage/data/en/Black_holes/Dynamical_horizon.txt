{"text": "In theoretical physics, in particular in numerical relativity, a dynamical horizon (DH) is a mathematical formalism that was originally developed by Abhay Ashtekar and others (see ).  It provides a description of a black hole that is evolving (e.g. one that has a non-zero mass-energy influx).  A related formalism, for black holes with zero influx, is an isolated horizon.\n\n==Formal definition==\nThe formal definition of a dynamical horizon is as follows:\n\n== See also ==\n*Isolated horizon\n*Non-expanding horizon\n\n== References ==\n\n===Cross-reference===\n\n===Sources used===\n\n*\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n===Broad outlines===\n*\n\n===Major papers===\n* \n*\n\n===Other work===\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n*", "spanish_url": "", "original_url": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_horizon"}
