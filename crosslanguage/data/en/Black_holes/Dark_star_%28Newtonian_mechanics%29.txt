{"text": "A dark star is a theoretical object compatible with Newtonian mechanics that, due to its large mass, has a surface escape velocity that equals or exceeds the speed of light.  How light is affected by gravity under Newtonian mechanics is questionable but if it were accelerated the same way as projectiles, any light emitted at the surface of a dark star would be trapped by the star\u2019s gravity, rendering it dark, hence the name.\n\n==Dark star history==\n===John Michell and dark stars===\nDuring 1783 geologist John Michell wrote a long letter to Henry Cavendish outlining the expected properties of dark stars, published by The Royal Society in their 1784 volume. Michell calculated that when the escape velocity at the surface of a star was equal to or greater than lightspeed, the generated light would be gravitationally trapped, so that the star would not be visible to a distant astronomer.\n\nMichell\u2019s idea for calculating the number of such \"invisible\" stars anticipated 20th century astronomers' work: he suggested that since a certain proportion of double-star systems might be expected to contain at least one \"dark\" star, we could search for and catalogue as many double-star systems as possible, and identify cases where only a single circling star was visible. This would then provide some sort of statistical baseline for calculating the amount of other unseen stellar matter that might exist in addition to the visible stars.\n\n===Dark stars and gravitational shifts===\nMichell also suggested that future astronomers might be able to identify the surface gravity of a distant star by seeing how far the star\u2019s light was shifted to the weaker end of the spectrum, a precursor of Einstein\u2019s 1911 gravity-shift argument. However, Michell cited Newton as saying that blue light was less energetic than red (Newton thought that more massive particles were associated with bigger wavelengths), so Michell\u2019s predicted spectral shifts were in the wrong direction. It is difficult to tell whether Michell\u2019s careful citing of Newton\u2019s position on this may have reflected a lack of conviction on Michell\u2019s part over whether Newton was correct, or whether it was just academic thoroughness.\n\n===Wave theory of light===\nIn 1796, the mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace promoted the same idea in the first and second editions of his book Exposition du syst\u00e8me du Monde, apparently independently of Michell.\n\nLaplace may have been removed it from later editions because of the development of the wave theory of light; light which was then thought to be a massless wave, and therefore not influenced by gravity. Although the German physicist, mathematician and astronomer Johann Georg von Soldner, continued with Newton's Corpuscular theory of light as late as 1804 as a group physicist dropped the idea.\n\n===Indirect radiation===\nDark stars and black holes both have a surface escape velocity equal or greater than lightspeed, and a critical radius of r \u2264 2M.\n\nHowever, the dark star is capable of emitting indirect radiation \u2013 outward-aimed light and matter can leave the r = 2M surface briefly before being recaptured, and whilst outside the critical surface, can interact with other matter, or be accelerated free from the star by a chance encounter with other matter. A dark star therefore has a rarefied atmosphere of \u201cvisiting particles\u201d, and this ghostly halo of matter and light can radiate, albeit weakly.\n\nThe other point is that as FTL is possible in Newtonian physics, it is possible that objects may fly out with enough force to escape.\n\n==Comparisons with black holes ==\n; Radiation effects\n: A dark star may emit indirect radiation as described above.  Black holes as described by current theories about quantum mechanics emit radiation through a different process, Hawking radiation, first postulated in 1975.  The radiation emitted by a dark star depends on its composition and structure; Hawking radiation, by the no-hair theorem is generally thought of as depending only on the black hole's mass, charge, and angular momentum, although the black hole information paradox makes this controversial.\n\n; Light-bending effects\n: Although \"historical\" Newtonian arguments may lead to the gravitational deflection of light (Newton, Cavendish, Soldner), general relativity predicts twice as much deflection in a lightbeam skimming the Sun. This difference can be explained by the additional contribution of the curvature of space under modern theory: while Newtonian gravitation is analogous to the space-time components of general relativity's Riemann curvature tensor, the curvature tensor also contains purely spatial components, and both forms of curvature contribute to the total deflection.\n\nIn Newtonian physics, as FTL is possible so unlike a modern black hole a Dark star has no event horizon but like a modern black hole, the gravity in such a Dark star might overwhelm mass and energy into an infinitely small space. If so it would create a naked singularity.\n\n==See also==\n\n* Black hole\n* Magnetospheric eternally collapsing object\n* Q star\n\n==References==\n\n* Katherine Freese, Paolo Gondolo, and Douglas Spolyar \"The Effect of Dark Matter on the First Stars: A New Phase of Stellar Evolution\", Proceedings of First Stars III, Santa Fe, New Mexico, 16\u201320 July (2007).\n\n* Simon Schaffer \"John Michell and black holes\", Journal for the History of Astronomy 10 42\u201343 (1979)\n* Gary Gibbons, \"The man who invented black holes work emerges out of the dark after two centuries\", New Scientist, 28 June pp. 1101 (1979)\n* J Eisenstaedt, \"De L'influence de la gravitation sur la propagation de la lumi\u00e8re en th\u00e9orie Newtonienne.
