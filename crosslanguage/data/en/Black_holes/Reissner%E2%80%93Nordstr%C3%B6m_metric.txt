{"text": "In physics and astronomy, the Reissner&ndash;Nordstr\u00f6m metric is a static solution to the Einstein-Maxwell field equations, which corresponds to the gravitational field of a charged, non-rotating, spherically symmetric body of mass M.\n\nThe metric was discovered by Hans Reissner and Gunnar Nordstr\u00f6m.\n\nThese four related solutions may be summarized by the following table:\n\nwhere Q represents the body's electric charge and J represents its spin angular momentum.\n\n==The metric==\n\nIn spherical coordinates (t, r, \u03b8, \u03c6), the line element for the Reissner&ndash;Nordstr\u00f6m metric is\n\n:\nds^2 = \n\\left( 1 - \\frac{r_\\mathrm{S}}{r} + \\frac{r_Q^2}{r^2} \\right) c^2\\, dt^2 - \\frac{1}{1 - r_\\mathrm{S}/r + r_Q^2/r^2}\\, dr^2 - r^2\\, d\\theta^2 - r^2 \\sin^2 \\theta \\, d\\phi^2,\n\nwhere c is the speed of light, t is the time coordinate (measured by a stationary clock at infinity), r is the radial coordinate, rS is the Schwarzschild radius of the body given by\n:\nr_{s} = \\frac{2GM}{c^2},\n\nand rQ is a characteristic length scale given by\n:\nr_{Q}^{2} = \\frac{Q^2 G}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_{0} c^4}.\n\nHere 1/4\u03c0\u03b50 is Coulomb force constant.\n\nIn the limit that the charge Q (or equivalently, the length-scale rQ) goes to zero, one recovers the Schwarzschild metric.  The classical Newtonian theory of gravity may then be recovered in the limit as the ratio rS/r goes to zero. In that limit that both rQ/r and rS/r go to zero, the metric becomes the Minkowski metric for special relativity.\n\nIn practice, the ratio rS/r is often extremely small.  For example, the Schwarzschild radius of the Earth is roughly 9 mm (3/8 inch), whereas a satellite in a geosynchronous orbit has a radius r that is roughly four billion times larger, at 42,164 km (26,200 miles).  Even at the surface of the Earth, the corrections to Newtonian gravity are only one part in a billion. The ratio only becomes large close to black holes and other ultra-dense objects such as neutron stars.\n\n==Charged black holes==\nAlthough charged black holes with rQ \u226a rS are similar to the Schwarzschild black hole, they have two horizons: the event horizon and an internal Cauchy horizon.  As with the Schwarzschild metric, the event horizons for the spacetime are located where the metric component grr diverges; that is, where\n\n: 0 = 1/g^{rr} = 1 - \\frac{r_\\mathrm{S}}{r} + \\frac{r_Q^2}{r^2}.\n\nThis equation has two solutions:\n\n:\nr_\\pm = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(r_{s} \\pm \\sqrt{r_{s}^2 - 4r_{Q}^2}\\right).\n\nThese concentric event horizons become degenerate for 2rQ = rS, which corresponds to an extremal black hole. Black holes with 2rQ > rS are believed not to exist in nature because they would contain a naked singularity; their appearance would contradict Roger Penrose's cosmic censorship hypothesis which is generally believed to be true. Theories with supersymmetry usually guarantee that such \"superextremal\" black holes cannot exist.\n\nThe electromagnetic potential is\n\n:A_{\\alpha} = \\left(Q/r, 0, 0, 0\\right).\n\nIf magnetic monopoles are included in the theory, then a generalization to include magnetic charge P is obtained by replacing Q2 by Q2 + P2 in the metric and including the term Pcos&thinsp;\u03b8 d\u03c6 in the electromagnetic potential.\n\n==See also==\n\n*Black hole electron\n\n==Notes==\n\n==References==\n\n==External links==\n*spacetime diagrams including Finkelstein diagram and Penrose diagram, by Andrew J.
