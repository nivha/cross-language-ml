{"text": "In general relativity, a black brane is a solution of the equations that generalizes a black hole solution but it is also extended \u2014and translationally symmetric\u2014 in p additional spatial dimensions. That type of solution would be called a black p-brane. (http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/black+brane)\n\nIn string theory, the solutions labeled as black branes provide us with an alternative description of the same objects called p-branes. Other descriptions of the same objects include D-branes. Some approximations of black branes might lead to entropy consistent with energy, from E=mc2.\n\nThe metric for a black p-brane in a n-dimensional space-time is:\n\n:\n{d s}^{2} =\n\\left( \\eta_{ab} + \\frac{r_s^{n-p-3}}{r^{n-p-3}} u_a u_b \\right) d \\sigma^a d \\sigma^b + \\left(1-\\frac{r_s^{n-p-3}}{r^{n-p-3}}\\right)^{-1} dr^2 + r^2 d \\Omega^2_{n-p-2}\n\nwhere:\n*\u03b7 is the (p+1)-Minkowski metric with signature (-,+,+,+,...),\n*\u03c3 are the coordinates for the worldsheet of the black p-brane,\n*u is its four-velocity,\n*r is the radial coordinate and,\n*\u03a9 is the metric for a (n-p-2)-sphere, surrounding the brane.", "spanish_url": "", "original_url": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_brane"}
