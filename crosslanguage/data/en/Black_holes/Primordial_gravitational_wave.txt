{"text": "In physics, primordial gravitational waves are gravitational waves observed in the cosmic microwave background.\n\nReports stated in March 2014 that BICEP instrument have detected B-modes from gravitational waves in the early universe. An announcement was made on 17 March 2014 from the Harvard\u2013Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics announcing that BICEP2 had detected B-modes at the level of , disfavouring the null hypothesis () at the level of 7 sigma (5.9\u03c3 after foreground subtraction).\n\nModels of cosmic inflation predict that gravitational waves should appear; thus, their detection supports the theory of inflation, and the strength can confirm and exclude different models of inflation.\n\n==References==", "spanish_url": "", "original_url": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primordial_gravitational_wave"}
