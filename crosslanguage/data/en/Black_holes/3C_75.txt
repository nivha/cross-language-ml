{"text": "3C75 (aka 3C 75) is a binary black hole system in the Abell 400 cluster of galaxies. It has four radio jets (two from each accreting black hole). It is travelling at 1200 kilometers per second through the cluster plasma, causing the jets to be swept back. The binary supermassive black holes are themselves contained in the dumbbell shaped galaxy NGC 1128. 3C 75 may be X-ray source 2A 0252+060 (1H 0253+058, XRS 02522+060).\n\n==References==\n\n==External links==\n*What is known about 3C 75\n*Binary Black Hole in 3C 75.
