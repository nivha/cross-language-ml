{"text": "A black string is a higher dimensional (D>4) generalization of a black hole in which the event horizon is topologically equivalent to S2 &times; S1 and spacetime is asymptotically Md&minus;1 &times; S1.\n\nPerturbations of black string solutions were found to be unstable for L (the length around S1) greater than some threshold L&prime;.  The full non-linear evolution of a black string beyond this threshold might result in a black string breaking up into separate black holes which would coalesce into a single black hole.  This scenario seems unlikely because it was realized a black string could not pinch off in finite time, shrinking S2 to a point and then evolving to some Kaluza-Klein black hole.  When perturbed, the black string would settle into a stable, static non-uniform black string state.", "spanish_url": "", "original_url": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_string"}
