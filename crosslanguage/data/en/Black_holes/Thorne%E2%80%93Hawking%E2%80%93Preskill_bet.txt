{"text": "The Thorne\u2013Hawking\u2013Preskill bet was a public bet on the outcome of the black hole information paradox made in 1997 by physics theorists Kip Thorne and Stephen Hawking on the one side, and John Preskill on the other.\n\nThorne and Hawking argued that since general relativity made it impossible for black holes to radiate, and lose information, the mass-energy and information carried by Hawking radiation must be \"new\", and must not originate from inside the black hole event horizon. Since this contradicted the idea under quantum mechanics of microcausality, quantum mechanics would need to be rewritten.  Preskill argued the opposite, that since quantum mechanics suggests that the information emitted by a black hole relates to information that fell in at an earlier time, the view of black holes given by general relativity must be modified in some way.  The winner of the bet would receive an encyclopedia of the winners's choice.\n\nIn 2004, Hawking announced that he was conceding the bet, and that he now believed that black hole horizons should fluctuate and leak information, in doing so providing Preskill with a copy of Total Baseball, The Ultimate Baseball Encyclopedia.  Comparing the useless information obtainable from a black hole to \"burning an encyclopedia\", Hawking later joked, \"I gave John an encyclopedia of baseball, but maybe I should just have given him the ashes.\"  Thorne, however, remained unconvinced of Hawking's proof and declined to contribute to the award. As of 2008, Hawking's argument that he has solved the paradox has not yet been accepted by the community, and a consensus has not yet been reached that Hawking has provided a strong enough argument that this is in fact what happens.\n\nHawking had earlier speculated that the singularity at the centre of a black hole could form a bridge to a \"baby universe\", into which the lost information could pass; such theories have been very popular in science fiction. But according to Hawking's new idea, presented at the 17th International Conference on General Relativity and Gravitation, on 21 July 2004 in Dublin, black holes eventually transmit, in a garbled form, information about all matter they swallow:\n\n== Earlier Thorne\u2013Hawking bet ==\nAnother older bet \u2013 about the existence of black holes \u2013 was described by Hawking as an \"insurance policy\" of sorts:\n\nIn the updated and expanded edition of A Brief History of Time, Hawking states that \"Although the situation with Cygnus X-1 has not changed much since we made the bet in 1975, there is now so much other observational evidence in favour of black holes that I have conceded the bet. I paid the specified penalty, which was a one year subscription to Penthouse, to the outrage of Kip's liberated wife.\"\n\n==See also==\n*Hawking radiation\n*Scientific wager\n\n==References==", "spanish_url": "", "original_url": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorne%E2%80%93Hawking%E2%80%93Preskill_bet"}
