Ordinary matter is divided into luminous matter (the stars and luminous gases and 0.005% radiation) and nonluminous matter (intergalactic gas and about 0.1% neutrinos and 0.04% supermassive black holes). Ordinary matter is uncommon. Modeled after Ostriker and Steinhardt. For more information, see NASA.]] \nIn astrophysics and cosmology scalar field dark matter is a classical, minimally coupled, real scalar field postulated to account for the inferred dark matter.\n\n==Background==\nThe universe may be accelerating, fueled perhaps by a cosmological constant or some\nother field possessing long range \u2018repulsive\u2019 effects. A model must predict the correct form for\nthe large scale clustering spectrum, account for cosmic microwave background anisotropies on large and intermediate angular scales, and provide agreement with the luminosity distance relation obtained from observations of high redshift supernovae. The modeled evolution of the universe includes a large amount of unknown matter in order to agree with such observations. This matter has two components cold dark matter and dark energy. Each contributes to the theory of the origination of galaxies and the expansion of the universe. The universe must have a critical density, a density not explained by  baryonic matter (ordinary matter) alone.\n\n==Scalar field==\nThe dark matter can be modeled as a scalar field using two fitted parameters. In this picture the dark matter consists of an ultralight particle with a mass of 1.1 \u00d7 10\u221223 eV\n\nThe uncertainty in position of a particle is larger than its Compton wavelength, and for some reasonable estimates of particle mass and density of dark matter there is no point talking about the individual particle's position and momentum. The dark matter is more like a wave than a particle, and the galactic halos are giant systems of condensed bose liquid. The dark matter can be described as a Bose\u2013Einstein condensate of the ultralight quanta of the field\n and as boson stars. The enormous Compton wavelength of these particles prevents structure formation on small subgalactic scales, which is a major problem in traditional cold dark matter models.\n\nThe collapse of initial overdensities is studied in Refs.\n\n==See also==\n*Weakly interacting massive particles\n*Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model\n*Neutralino\n*Axion\n*Dark matter halo\n*Light dark matter\n*Hot dark matter\n*Warm dark matter\n\n==References==\n\n==External links==\n* Scaled-Up Darkness, Scientific American", "spanish_url": "", "original_url": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_field_dark_matter"}
