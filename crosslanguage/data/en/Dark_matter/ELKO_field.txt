In cosmology and theoretical physics the ELKO field is a dark matter candidate.

The ELKO field was originally suggested in 2005 by D. V. Ahluwalia (then, under the name Ahluwalia-Khalilova) and D. Grumiller. The name comes from the acronym of the original German term Eigenspinoren des LadungsKonjugationsOperators, designating spinors that are eigenspinors of the charge conjugation operator.

ELKO quantum fields Ô¨Åelds describe spin-1/2 fermions with mass dimension one. Since the field has a mass dimensionality mismatch with standard model matter fields it was suggested as a dark matter candidate. As a result of their scalar-like mass dimension they differ significantly from the mass dimension 3/2 Dirac fermions.
