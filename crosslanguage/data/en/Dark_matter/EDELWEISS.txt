{"text": "EDELWEISS (Exp\u00e9rience pour DEtecter Les Wimps En Site Souterrain) is a dark matter search experiment located in the Modane Underground Laboratory. The experiment uses cryogenic detectors, measuring both the phonon and ionization signals produced by particle interactions in germanium crystals. This technique allows nuclear recoils events to be distinguished from electron recoil events.\n\nThe EURECA project is a proposed future dark matter experiment, which will involve researchers from EDELWEISS and the CRESST dark matter search.\n\n== Dark matter ==\n\nDark matter is material which does not emit or absorb light. Measurements of the rotation curves of spiral galaxies suggest it makes up the majority of the mass of galaxies; and precision measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation suggest it accounts for a significant fraction of the density of the Universe.\n\nA possible explanation of dark matter comes from particle physics. WIMP (Weakly Interacting Massive Particle) is a general term for hypothetical particles which interact only through the weak nuclear and gravitational force. This theory suggests our galaxy is surrounded by a dark halo of such particles. EDELWEISS is one of a number of dark matter search experiments aiming to directly detect WIMP dark matter, by detecting the elastic scattering of a WIMP off an atom within a particle detector. As the interaction rate is so low, this requires sensitive detectors, good background discrimination, and a deep underground site (to reduce the background from cosmic rays).\n\n==Experiment==\nEDELWEISS is located in the Modane underground laboratory, in the Fr\u00e9jus road tunnel between France and Italy, below 1800m of rock. A 20 cm lead shield reduces the gamma background, and a polyethylene shield reduces the neutron flux. All materials close to the detectors are screened for radiopurity. A dilution refrigerator is used to cool the detectors, built in the opposite orientation to most instruments with the detectors at the top and the refrigeration mechanism below.\n\nEDELWEISS uses high purity germanium cryogenic bolometers cooled to ~20mK temperature. The phonon and ionization signals produced by a particle interaction are measured. This allows background events to be rejected as nuclear recoils events (produced by WIMP or neutron interactions) produce much less ionization than electron recoil events (produced by alpha, beta and gamma radiation). The detectors are similar to those used by the CDMS experiment. Simultaneous detection of ionization and heat with semiconductors at low temperature was an original idea by Lawrence M. Krauss, Mark Srednicki and Frank Wilczek.\n\nA major limitation of early detectors was the problem of surface events. Due to incomplete charge collection, a particle interaction near the surface of the crystal gave no ionization signal, so electron recoils near the surface could be mistaken for nuclear recoils. To avoid this problem, the collaboration have developed new detectors with interdigitised electrodes. Different voltages are applied to a series of electrodes so the direction of electric field is different near the surface of the crystal. This allows over 99.5% of surface events to be rejected.\n\nThe results from the first phase of the experiment (EDELWEISS I) have been published, excluding WIMP dark matter with an interaction cross-section above ~10\u22126pb. The current phase (EDELWEISS II) is now taking data. The experiment will run through 2010, after which the EURECA experiment plans to start construction in the Modane laboratory.\n\n==Collaboration==\nEDELWEISS is a collaboration of the following member institutions:\n\n===CEA \u2013 Commissariat \u00e0 l'\u00c9nergie Atomique ===\n* IRFU - Institut de Recherche sur les Lois Fondamentales de l'Univers\n* IRAMIS - Institut Rayonnement Mati\u00e8re de Saclay\n\n===CNRS \u2013 Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique===\n* CSNSM - Centre de Spectrom\u00e9trie Nucl\u00e9aire et de Spectrom\u00e9trie de Masse, Orsay\n* IPNL - Institut de Physique Nucl\u00e9aire de Lyon\n* Institut N\u00c9EL, Grenoble\n* IAS - Institut d'Astrophysique Spatiale, Paris\n\n===Institutions outside France===\n* Universit\u00e4t Karlsruhe, Germany\n* Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe, Germany\n* JINR \u2013 Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, Dubna, Russia\n* University of Oxford\n\n==See also==\n*Commissariat \u00e0 l'\u00e9nergie atomique\n*Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique\n*Dark Matter\n*Weakly Interacting Massive Particle\n*Cryogenic Dark Matter Search\n*EURECA\n*CRESST\n\n==References==\n\n==External links==\n* EDELWEISS Collaboration home page\n* EURECA Collaboration home page", "spanish_url": "", "original_url": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EDELWEISS"}
