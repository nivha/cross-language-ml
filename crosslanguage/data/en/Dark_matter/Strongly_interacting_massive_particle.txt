Strongly interacting massive particles (SIMPs) are hypothetical particles that interact strongly with ordinary matter, but could form the inferred dark matter despite this.

Strongly interacting massive particles have been proposed as a solution for the ultra-high-energy cosmic-ray problem and for the absence of cooling flows. Various experiments and observations have set constraints on SIMP dark matter.D. Javorsek II, E. Fischbach and V.
