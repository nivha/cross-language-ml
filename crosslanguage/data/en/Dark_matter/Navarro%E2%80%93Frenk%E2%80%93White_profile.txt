{"text": "The Navarro\u2013Frenk\u2013White profile or NFW profile is a spatial mass distribution of dark matter fitted to dark matter haloes identified in N-body simulations by Julio Navarro, Carlos Frenk and Simon White. The NFW profile is one of the most commonly used model profiles for dark matter halos.\n\n==Density distribution==\n\nIn the NFW profile, the density of dark matter as a function of radius is given by:\n\n\\rho (r)=\\frac{\\rho_0}{\\frac{r}{R_s}\\left(1~+~\\frac{r}{R_s}\\right)^2}\n\nwhere \u03c10 and the \"scale radius\", Rs, are parameters which vary from halo to halo.\n\nThe integrated mass inside of some radius Rmax is\n\nM=\\int_0^{R_{max}} 4\\pi r^2 \\rho (r) dr=4\\pi \\rho_0 R_s^3 \\left[\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{R_s+R_{max}}{R_s}\\right)-\\frac{R_{max}}{R_s+R_{max}}\\right]\n\nThe total mass is divergent, but it is often useful to take the edge of the halo to\nbe the virial radius, Rvir ,\nwhich is related to the \"concentration parameter\", c, and scale radius via\n\nR_{vir}=cR_s\n\nThe virial radius is often referred to as  R_{200} , and is defined as the radius at which the average density within this radius is 200 times the critical density. In this case, the total mass in the halo is\n\nM=\\int_0^{R_{vir}} 4\\pi r^2 \\rho (r) dr=4\\pi \\rho_0 R_s^3 \\left- \\frac{c}{1+c}\\right\n\nThe value of c is roughly 10 or 15 for the Milky Way, and may range from 4 to 40\nfor halos of various sizes.\n\nThe integral of the squared density is\n\n\\int_0^{R_{max}} 4\\pi r^2 \\rho (r)^2 dr=\\frac{4\\pi}{3} R_s^3 \\rho_0^2\n\\left[1-\\frac{R_s^3}{(R_s+R_{max})^3}\\right]\n\nso that the mean squared density inside of Rmax is\n\n\\langle \\rho^2 \\rangle_{R_{max}}=\\frac{R_s^3\\rho_0^2}{R_{max}^3}\n\\left[1-\\frac{R_s^3}{(R_s+R_{max})^3}\\right]\n\nwhich for the virial radius simplifies to\n\n\\langle \\rho^2 \\rangle_{R_{vir}}=\\frac{\\rho_0^2}{c^3}\n\\left[1-\\frac{1}{(1+c)^3}\\right]\n\\approx \\frac{\\rho_0^2}{c^3}\n\nand the mean squared density inside the scale radius is simply\n\n\\langle \\rho^2 \\rangle_{R_s}=\\frac{7}{8}\\rho_0^2\n\n==Dark matter simulations==\nThe NFW profile is an approximation to the equilibrium configuration of dark matter produced in simulations of collisionless dark matter particles by numerous groups of scientists. Before the dark matter virializes, the distribution of dark matter deviates from an NFW profile, and significant substructure is observed in simulations both during and after the collapse of the halos.\n\nAlternative models, in particular the Einasto profile, have been shown to represent the dark matter profiles of simulated halos as well as or better than the NFW profile. The Einasto profile has a finite (zero) central slope, unlike the NFW profile which has a divergent (infinite) central density. Because of the limited resolution of N-body simulations, it is not yet known which model provides the best description of the central densities of simulated dark-matter halos.\n\n==Observations of halos==\nThe observations of both the Milky Way and M31 may be compatible with the NFW profile for the dark matter halo.  The dark matter profile of smaller galaxies tend to have flatter distributions of dark matter in the central region, known as the Cuspy halo problem.\n\n==References==", "spanish_url": "", "original_url": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navarro%E2%80%93Frenk%E2%80%93White_profile"}
